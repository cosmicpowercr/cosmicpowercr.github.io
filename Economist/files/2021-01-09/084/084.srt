00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:27,190
WHEN WILLIAM BARENTS, a Dutch navigator, sailed to the Arctic in 1594, he was pursuing the dream of a warm northern ocean first posited by the Greeks.

2
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:36,990
The idea of a polar trade route to the Orient—above North America or the Russian Far East—enticed European explorers for centuries.

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,600
Yet it proved a“lethal delusion”, and Barents’s missions a template for many harrowing trials.

4
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,799
Beyond the sea north of Scandinavia that bears his name, Barents and his tale are little known.

5
00:00:51,330 --> 00:01:02,020
Considered“the first true polar voyage”, his quest was eclipsed by the 19th-century exploits of Robert Peary and the ill-fated expedition led by John Franklin.

6
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:12,579
Andrea Pitzer, an American journalist, recently sailed the same seas to Nova Zembla to recount this earlier, nail- biting feat of seafaring.

7
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:22,470
Backed by Dutch merchants keen to make their fledgling state a maritime power, Barents made three journeys north in the 1590s.

8
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:35,760
Ms Pitzer relies not just on a 19th-century translation of the journals of Gerrit de Veer, who accompanied the voyages, but on a previously untranslated account by a merchant representative.

9
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:45,139
The polar ice was insurmountable on the first two expeditions; they were largely uneventful and barely stir a reader’s blood.

10
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:56,690
But once Barents heads for the northern tip of Nova Zembla for the third time in May 1596, the story becomes dramatic, and dire.

11
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:05,989
He and his crew break away from a companion ship to forge on alone, determined to be first to find the elusive passage.

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:15,170
For weeks the 17 men fight off polar bears that rear up from nowhere, attacking until they are slaughtered or driven away.

13
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:29,840
The ship tacks endlessly and desperately to escape floating“mountains of steel”: icebergs so impenetrable that the only way through is to drill holes and pray they will split apart.

14
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:40,349
By mid- September the vessel is frozen fast, and the men resign themselves to overwintering“in great cold, poverty, misery and griefe”.

15
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:49,430
Poorly clad and ravaged by scurvy, they are“phenomenally unprepared”for the ordeal, Ms Pitzer observes.

16
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,310
Yet the remains of the shelter they managed to build stood for nearly 300 years.

17
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:05,190
Of the men themselves, 13 live through this long polar night—eight months of what the author neatly terms“the monotony of survival”.

18
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:15,560
They dig out from continual blizzards, scavenging for fuel and Arctic foxes whose meat contains just enough vitamin C to sustain them.

19
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:26,140
Still, the journey is filled with wonders: optical phenomena and mysteries unravelled, such as where European songbirds go each summer.

20
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,020
Ms Pitzer’s descriptions of the region sing.

21
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:37,139
“Bits of floating ice released tiny bubbles of air, hissing like oil in a skillet,”she writes.

22
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,950
“The many languages of water surrounded them day and night.”

23
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,390
Barents’s heroism helped make the Arctic explorer a mythically resilient figure.

24
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:53,000
The fantasy that drove him, meanwhile, has nearly come to pass.

25
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,910
Arctic ice has been shrinking for several decades, with a sharp drop-off after 2006.

26
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:11,290
Human ingenuity, epitomised by expeditions like his, has in 400 years made the Dutchman’s dream a terrifying reality.
