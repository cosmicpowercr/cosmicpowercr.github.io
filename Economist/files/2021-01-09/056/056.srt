1
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:32,590
AMERICA’S BIGGEST spread of silicon for turning photons into power sits in the Mojave desert about 100km north of downtown Los Angeles.

2
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:41,570
The Solar Star facility consists of 1,7m solar modules on 13 square kilometres of land.

3
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,160
On sunny days it can feed more than half a gigawatt into the grid.

4
00:00:46,520 --> 00:01:01,490
In a nice inversion of the old solar-booster’s saw that the Sun provides enough energy in an hour to power civilisation for a year, Solar Star provides enough energy in a year to power civilisation for about an hour.

5
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,600
Such installations are changing the world.

6
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:13,390
Other photon-driven technologies, those concerned with the gathering and transmission of information, have already done so.

7
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:26,729
Five-and-a-half hours’ drive north-west from Solar Star, at a national laboratory in Silicon Valley called SLAC, you can find the world’s biggest spread of silicon for turning photons into information.

8
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:41,080
It consists of 189 specialised chips arranged in a disk about 64cm across which will occupy the focal plane of the world’s largest digital camera.

9
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:50,570
Over ten years it willproduce a database in which the positions and behaviours of hundreds of billions of celestial objects will be stored.

10
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:59,990
This array is remarkable in various ways, including its size, the fidelity of its electronics and the precision of its alignment.

11
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,239
But in its essence is not that different from the heart of a 1980s camcorder.

12
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:15,549
Just as it is possible to produce a chip with millions of transistors on it, it is possible to produce a chip with millions of photon receivers on it.

13
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,619
Fitted with the right lenses and mirrors, such chips can take pictures.

14
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:25,480
Later this year the array now at SLAC will be shipped to the Vera C.

15
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:34,250
Rubin Observatory, a new facility in the Chilean Andes named after an American astronomer who pioneered research into“dark matter”.

16
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:51,870
There light from distant galaxies will bounce off the three mirrors of the observatory’s telescope and pass through three huge camera lenses so as to form a pin- sharp image on the array’s perfectly flat 189-chip surface.

17
00:02:52,370 --> 00:03:06,140
On each of those chips sit 16m“charge-coupled devices”(CCDs), each containing a p-n junction where incoming photons can knock loose electrons.

18
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,880
Each time a far-flung photon does so, the liberated electron is stored in a tiny capacitor.

19
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,730
During the 15 seconds of a typical exposure some of these capacitors will store dozens of electrons.

20
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,040
Some will store none.

21
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:35,559
At the end of the exposure, each of the array’s 3,2bn CCDs will pass its electrons on to the element next door like a string of emergency workers passing sandbags.

22
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:49,160
Circuits at the end of the sandbag line will count the electrons from each element, and use their number to establish the brightness of the corresponding pixel in the resultant 3,2 gigapixel image.

23
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:57,240
These images will contain 50 times more data than those produced by the best digital cameras used in cinema.

24
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:18,990
They will capture patches of sky 40 times the apparent size of the Moon at a level of detail that would pick out a golf ball 25km away; the faintest of the millions of things seen in each frame will be 25m times fainter than the dimmest stars that can be seen with the naked eye.

25
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,320
But single frames are not enough.

26
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:29,930
The telescope will scan the whole sky every few days for a decade, producing hundreds of images of every part of it.

27
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:39,050
Comparing each new image with its predecessors will reveal celestial change: bodies moving, brightening, vanishing.

28
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:49,830
Unusual changes will needto be swiftly followed up to see if they reveal something fundamentally new, which means data must be got off the mountain as fast as possible.

29
00:04:50,320 --> 00:05:00,840
That will be done with photon-based technology as remarkable, in its way, as the CCD array—but as ubiquitous as the great camera is unique.

30
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:13,490
The information that comes into the observatory as a drizzle of photons from the far reaches of the universe will leave it encoded on a stream of photons pulsing down an optical fibre.

31
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:22,629
A Chilean outfit which provides connectivity for science and education, REUNA, gets the data from the observatory to Santiago.

32
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:33,290
Another data-service provider, Ampath, provides a link to Miami using either an undersea cable in the Pacific or one in the Atlantic, depending on traffic.

33
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,850
From Miami the data flash to SLAC.

34
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:50,490
If the software which checks for changes sees something exciting the world will receive breaking news from the most distant of elsewheres less than a minute after the relevant photons arrived at the camera.

35
00:05:51,940 --> 00:06:05,820
And while en route to and from California, the data will be surrounded within optical fibres by vastly more, vastly more mundane data travelling from person to person or from device to cloud.

36
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:13,830
In terms of astronomy the Rubin observatory’s 60,000 terabyte database will be the biggest thing ever.

37
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,700
In terms of the data that today’s world produces and moves around it is a drop in the ocean.

38
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:37,990
Optical-fibre networks are the backbones of every national telecoms system; they connect six of the seven continents to each other and link the phone masts which serve billions of smartphones to the clouds where their data can be processed and stored.

39
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:46,180
Big data can only be usefully big because these narrow highways provide so much data-transfer capacity.

40
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,820
Through a glass, brightly The light which goes into those fibres is made in semiconductors.

41
00:06:52,289 --> 00:07:07,490
There are various sorts of device which can reverse what goes on in a photovoltaic cell, turning current into light by means of a p-n junction, though typically in a mixture of gallium and arsenic, rather than in silicon.

42
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:20,170
The simplest, light- emitting diodes (LEDs), are increasingly used to illuminate the screens of televisions, computers and phones, as well as the rooms in which people use those devices.

43
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:34,510
LEDs’ ability to make light without heat—unlike a star or anincandescent bulb—makes them much more efficient than a light based on a hot filament can be, and also much longer lasting.

44
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:51,120
They have thus continued the trend, first discerned by William Nordhaus, an economist, for ever less of the cost of living to be spent on light, a significant and absolute gain in human welfare delivered through wave after wave of innovation.

45
00:07:51,970 --> 00:08:08,570
The light used in optical fibres mostly comes not from LEDs but from semiconductor lasers (of which more in the next chapter) that are built a bit differently; they squirt their light out along the plane of the p-n junction, which is to say out of the side of the chip.

46
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:22,810
At the far end this light is met by a photodiode—a device like a CCD, but in which the electrons knocked free by the incoming photons are processed immediately rather than stored.

47
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:27,750
Between them is a thread of glass of staggering transparency.

48
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:38,929
When researchers began to wonder, in the 1960s, whether light shone through glass fibres could be used for communications the idea seemed more than quixotic.

49
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:49,730
Even a thin layer of glass absorbs a fair amount of the light which passes through it; just half a centimetre of plate glass reduces brightness by 20%.

50
00:08:50,849 --> 00:09:02,660
The most transparent glass in the world, that used in endoscopes, was 200 times better—you could pass a light beam through a metre of it and only lose 20%.

51
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,810
But that still meant that, over 20 metres, 99% of the light would be absorbed.

52
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:24,360
If you fed all the photons with which the Sunprovides the Earth into one end of such a fibre, every single one of them would be absorbed before they had travelled a kilometre (and the fibre would have vapourised, but that’s another problem).

53
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:38,380
The one thing that the fibre aficionados had on their side was that no one had ever really tried to push the absorption barrier in glass, because glass rarely needed to be more than a couple of centimetres thick.

54
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,020
Given good reason to try, what had seemed impossible was quite quickly achieved.

55
00:09:44,450 --> 00:10:02,970
In 1965 Charles Kao, a researcher at STL, a British telecoms company, set the bar for practical communication at a loss of 99% of the incoming light over a kilometre of glass: that is, performance 50 times better than endoscope glass.

56
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:12,950
Within five years a researcher at Corning Glass, Donald Keck, had cleared that bar with a fibre which lost only 96% of light over a kilometre.

57
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,910
The development was not exactly smooth.

58
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:28,060
As well as technical hurdles there were cultural differences—telecoms researchers, mainly electronic engineers, did not understand glass, and glassmakers did not understand electronics.

59
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:47,379
Though in retrospect the technology’s promise seems obvious, many in telecoms remained convinced that microwaves guided by metal tubing were the future of high-data-rate communications; Bell Labs sidelined its optical-fibre team for years.

60
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,120
The economic downturn of the 1970s hit corporate investment plans.

61
00:10:52,760 --> 00:11:00,490
But by the early 1980s the technology was becoming good enough to compete with microwaves beamed from antenna to antenna.

62
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:08,620
And in 1982 the break-up of AT&T created a competitive market for long-distance telephony in America.

63
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,880
The newcomers, with no legacy technology, went for optical fibres.

64
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:24,700
In the mid-1980s a team at the University of Southampton developed optical amplifiers: stretches of fibre doped with erbium, a rare-earth element.

65
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:35,339
If you pump energy into the erbium atoms through the side of the fibre, they will produce new photons when hit by those coming down the length of the fibre, boosting the signal.

66
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:41,559
Such amplifiers made it possible to create optical fibre cables that could cross oceans.

67
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,510
The first, TAT-8, was laid in 1988.

68
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:57,090
Its 280 megabit-per-second (Mbps) capacity was ten times that of the previous link, which passed radio waves along coaxial cable.

69
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:04,670
Some thought it would take a decade for the cable to fill up; it reached full capacity in just 18 months.

70
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:23,140
Part of that capacity was a dedicated 1,5Mbps link between CERN, a European particle-physics lab, and Cornell University in upstate New York, one of the hubs of NSFnet, the scientific network which was then the backbone of the internet.

71
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:33,970
That link made it possible for Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN, to demonstrate his ideas about“browsers”and“HTML”to American colleagues.

72
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,910
TAT-8 put the“worldwide”into the world wide web.

73
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:45,340
From then on, optical-fibre capacity and the internet grew hand in hand.

74
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,329
As computers have improved, fibre capacity has kept up.

75
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:04,200
The innovation is mostly at the ends of the fibres, rather than in the fibre itself.

76
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:25,270
The Rubin observatory’s brand new system uses equipment from Infinera, an American company, which allows many different lasers with slightly different wavelengths to share the same fibre;“dense wave-division multiplexing”of this sort can now allow up to 80 wavelengths to be used at a time.

77
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:43,360
Once content to send information in“symbols”of just one bit—dim the laser for 1, brighten it for 0—engineers now use systems in which the phase of the laser’s light (the rise and fall of its peaks and troughs) encodesinformation, too.

78
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:50,430
Single symbols can now carry two or four bits of information, rather than just one.

79
00:13:51,380 --> 00:14:07,220
The latest transatlantic cable, Dunant, commissioned in 2020, contains 24 fibres and uses such tricks to carry 300 terabits per second—more than a million times what TAT-8 could cope with.

80
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:15,159
It was paid for not by a phone company, but by Google, and the tech giant plans to lay another in just two years’ time.

81
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:22,789
This is how information, whether from TikTok or a distant galaxy, girdles the Earth.
