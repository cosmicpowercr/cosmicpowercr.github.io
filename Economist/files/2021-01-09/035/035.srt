00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:28,950
ON DECEMBER 26TH a scuffle broke out between Syrian refugees and residents of the Lebanese town of Bhanine, north of Tripoli.

2
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,600
That night the row, allegedly over unpaid wages, turned ugly.

3
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,949
Shots were fired.

4
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,310
Armed villagers then set fire to the refugees’ tents, causing them to flee and sleep rough in nearby fields.

5
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,450
When they returned the next morning their makeshift camp was little more than a patch of charred debris.

6
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,700
The past year has been difficult for everyone in Lebanon.

7
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:00,930
The country has endured covid-19, the collapse of its currency and a huge explosion at Beirut’s port in August.

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:09,149
But the consequences of all this have been particularly bleak for the 884,000 Syrian refugees living there.

9
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:18,920
The United Nations estimates that 89% of them live in extreme poverty (up from 55% in 2019).

10
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:32,240
That means they make under 309,000 Lebanese pounds a month—a sum that is less than half the minimum wage and worth a mere $36 at unofficial exchange rates.

11
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:45,599
Some Lebanese politicians, including a former foreign minister, Gebran Bassil, have whipped up public anger towards refugees, blaming them (wrongly) for Lebanon’s economic collapse.

12
00:01:46,170 --> 00:02:00,200
The outrage in Bhanine was not an isolated incident: in November, after a Syrian refugee killed a Lebanese man in the northern town of Bcharre, hundreds of Syrians fled amid calls for their expulsion.

13
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,870
Yet for all their difficulties, Syrians in Lebanon are not clamouring to return home.

14
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:20,130
The number of registered refugees has fallen by 23% from its peak of 1,1m in 2014, a decrease of 263,000.

15
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,209
Only 55,000 of those have returned to Syria, though.

16
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:33,490
At the average pace over the past five years, it will take until around 2041 for the last Syrian refugee to leave Lebanon.

17
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:43,800
Eager to speed their exodus, the Lebanese government has increased pressure on refugees, stepping up deportations and restrictions.

18
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:57,250
In November, when Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria hosted a garish conference urging refugees to return to his shattered country, Lebanon was the only Arab state to send a delegation.

19
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:08,430
Researchers from the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University and ETH Zurich, a Swiss university, argue that such measures will fail.

20
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:18,169
In a working paper published in November, they found that 63% of Syrian refugees in Lebanon hope to return home one day.

21
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:30,620
Just 5%, however, expected to do so within the coming year, a stark gap between what refugees intend to do and what they are actively preparing to do.

22
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:39,040
Moreover, they found no correlation between the well-being of refugees in Lebanon and their desire to return home.

23
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:47,260
What matters, they argue, are the conditions not in Lebanon, but in Syria— and those are increasingly bleak.

24
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:58,480
Extortion starts at the border, where the Syrian government requires every citizen returning home to convert $100 into the debased local currency.

25
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:08,230
Once inside, Syrians encounter queues in which people wait for hours, sometimes days, to obtain essentials such as bread and fuel.

26
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:18,770
Those returning face the threat of forced conscription by a regime starved of manpower, and of arbitrary detention by a regime starved of cash.

27
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:33,540
A Syrian activist group, founded by a former inmate in the notorious Sednaya prison, reckons the government has squeezed $900m in bribes out of detainees’ families since the war began.

28
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:45,670
The trend is similar in Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, which together host two- thirds of the 6,6m registered Syrian refugees (see map).

29
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:54,890
Turkey has been the most hospitable, offering access to education and social services, though official and public hostility is mounting.

30
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,880
Egypt and Jordan have been less generous, but still offer more support than Lebanon.

31
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:11,780
Regardless of conditions, the results are the same: in all three countries the number of registered refugees has stayed roughly the same since 2017.

32
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:20,739
Without a real change in Syria, the refugees scattered across the region (and in Europe) are probably there to stay.

33
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,490
And as long as Mr Assad is in power, no real change is expected.
