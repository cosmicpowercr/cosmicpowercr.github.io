00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:23,330
POLITICALLY, COVID-19 has been good for Mark Rutte, the Netherlands’ prime minister.

2
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:30,630
Polls show his party’s support has risen from about 15% to 25% since March.

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,630
Not so for his sovereign, King Willem-Alexander.

4
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:45,270
In April 76% of Dutch said they trusted the king; in December that had dropped to 47%, according to Ipsos, a pollster.

5
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,519
Support for the monarchy as a whole fell from 74% to 60%.

6
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,599
The main cause seems to be two disastrous holidays.

7
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,290
In August Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima were photographed breaking social-distancing rules in Greece.

8
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:10,409
In October the family returned there during the Dutch autumn break, even as the Netherlands headed towards a lockdown.

9
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,830
The trip was cut short by public outrage.

10
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,290
The House of Orange has been one of Europe’s most popular royal families.

11
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,160
Its history is unusual.

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,789
When the Netherlands won independence from Habsburg Spain in the late 1500s, it started out as a republic.

13
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:34,420
The descendants of William of Orange, the nobleman who led the revolt, weregiven the odd title of“stadtholder”.

14
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,140
They tussled for power with the provincial delegates of the States-General.

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:48,460
In 1795 Dutch progressives backed by revolutionary France drove out the Oranges, who took refuge in England.

16
00:01:49,260 --> 00:02:00,560
It was not until 1815, when they returned after Napoleon’s defeat, that they became royalty, with the help of the anti-republican British and their allies.

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,139
By the 1900s they were typical constitutional monarchs.

18
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:12,910
They won kudos in the second world war, since Queen Juliana fled to London rather than accept Nazi occupation.

19
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:24,039
Though Willem-Alexander signs all laws, his main job is to meet business groups and charities and to give an annual speech (written by the government).

20
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:30,290
Like other modern royals, they appeal to the people by mixing pomp and folksiness.

21
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,470
This year’s shenanigans upset that balance.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,770
The royals disregarded covid-19 rules while flaunting their wealth: the king brought along his new yacht worth €2m ($2,5m).

23
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:58,249
“The Netherlands has a culture of ‘Stick your head up and get mowed down’, so the Oranges usually try to seem normal,”says Kysia Hekster of NOS, the national news broadcaster.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,320
The royals cost the state €46m a year for salaries, events, palace upkeep and so on.

25
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,060
But their private fortune is secret.

26
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:16,010
The Oranges are still well liked, but many Dutch think they have a right to know what is beneath the peel.
