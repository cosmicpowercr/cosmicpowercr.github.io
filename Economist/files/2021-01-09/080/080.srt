00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:23,090
“WHAT DO YOU call traditional medicine that works?”

2
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,710
“Medicine.”

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,680
This old joke contains more than a milligram of truth.

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:47,390
When, for example, Tu Youyou, a Chinese chemist, began testing the sweet wormwood used in local herbal remedies as a cure for malaria, her isolation of artemisinin saved millions of lives and earned her the Nobel prize for medicine in 2015.

5
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,620
But not every folk cure is so closely examined—nor is every condition.

6
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:07,290
Over 1,7bn people, most living in the world’s poorest countries, are affected by a group of 20 illnesses known as Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).

7
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:14,490
These often lead to disability and place a heavy burden on health-care systems badly equipped to deal with them.

8
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,960
They are referred to as“neglected”for a reason.

9
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:30,020
A study published in 2009, in International Health, estimated that they received only 0,6% of the money given by rich countries to poor ones for health purposes.

10
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,550
Things havenot improved since then.

11
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:49,700
A recent report by Policy Cures Research, an international think-tank, estimates the cash available for treating NTDs has been flat for a decade, with less allocated to all of them collectively than either malaria or tuberculosis receives alone.

12
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,730
This lack of resources has consequences.

13
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:18,590
In Ghana, though estimated rates of lymphatic filariasis (also known as elephantiasis) dropped by 88% between 2010 and 2018, those of schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia) and onchocerciasis (also known as river blindness) rose by 39% and 81% respectively.

14
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,320
However, Dorcas Osei-Safo of the University of Ghana has a plan to fight back.

15
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,320
Herbal medicine is important in the country.

16
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:36,090
Indeed, its Food and Drugs Authority has already approved several herbal remedies for use against diseases including malaria.

17
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,110
She intends to build on this approach.

18
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:51,050
To do so, she and her team first contacted several practitioners of traditional medicine and obtained samples of 15 treatments employed against a range of NTDs.

19
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,190
Some were mixtures of dried herbs, others watery concoctions.

20
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:08,040
Her goal was to test their effectiveness against laboratory cultures of a variety of disease-causing parasites, with the aim of isolating any active principles they might contain.

21
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,720
Nearly all the samples had some effect against one or more parasites.

22
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,230
But one stood out in particular when used against the trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness.

23
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:29,880
This was a dried mix of Aloe vera, a short-stemmed succulent, and Taraxacum officinale, the common dandelion.

24
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:41,850
Intrigued by that discovery, the team put the crude sample they were working on through two rounds of chromatography, to split it into its constituents, and repeated the tests on these.

25
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:58,970
Their analysis, just published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, revealed an oil which proved 30% more effective at killing trypanosome parasites than did diminazene aceturate, the standard anti- trypanosomal drug.

26
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:07,900
For many researchers, that would have been the cue for a trip to the patent office and negotiations with a drug company about further rounds of testing.

27
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:19,000
But for Dr Osei-Safo the point is not to make a refined pharmaceutical, but rather to direct those who are ill towards the best treatments available from herbalists.

28
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:33,399
Her next move, funding permitting, will be to try to understand better why the newly discovered oil is effective, and to establish in whatcircumstances the herbal remedy from which it is derived should be recommended.
