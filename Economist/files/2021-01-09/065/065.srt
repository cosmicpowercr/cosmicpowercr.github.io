00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:26,420
KITEX GARMENTS is one of the largest private companies in Kerala, a communist-led state in southern India.

2
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,300
Its embrace of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is enthusiastic.

3
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:44,430
In the fiscal year ending in March 2020 it allocated 5,3% of its average profit over the past three years to public roads, schools, housing and safe drinking water.

4
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:58,750
That makes it a poster-child for an Indian law passed in 2013, in the aftermath of a corporate fraud scandal, that requires Indian companies to divert at least 2% of annual profits to CSR projects.

5
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:09,850
Arguments leading up to the law’s approval pitted NGOs and populist politicians, who supported it, against India Inc, which said it merely created a new tax.

6
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:16,210
Several big corporate contributors argued that philanthropy would be damaged by government involvement.

7
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:26,559
A new study by Shivaram Rajgopal of Columbia Business School and Prasanna Tantri of the Indian School of Business suggests that last group has a point.

8
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,270
The researchers sifted through the filings of 39,000 companies to see how behaviour changed.

9
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:47,170
Advocates of the law will be pleased to see that the sum the average company channelled annually to CSR efforts rose slightly in fiscal 2014-19, compared with 2009-14.

10
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:50,580
It was not, however, an unalloyed triumph.

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,470
Kitex, with its consistently high charitable contributions, turns out to be an exception.

12
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:14,640
In place of spending on social causes, Mr Rajgopal and Ms Tantri found increased spending on advertising.

13
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:35,400
Economists studying CSR spending posit three possible incentives for it: genuine altruism; private interests of managers who enhance their own position with corporate cash; and improved performance and valuations as a consequence of a burnished reputation among customers and better morale among employees.

14
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:48,970
If the first two were at work, Mr Rajgopal and Ms Tantri speculate, India’s biggest spenders would not have cut back: setting a minimum payment would impede neither altruism nor benefits to managers.

15
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,430
Instead, the reduced payments suggest that past spending was mostly about“signallingvalue”.

16
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:02,430
Once they became obligatory, CSR payments were seen as merely another component of regulatory compliance.

17
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,740
Or, as Mr Rajgopal concludes,“The halo was lost.”

18
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:14,230
The question left open by the study is where CSR money goes and whether that too has been affected by the law.

19
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,330
Many Indian businesses are family- controlled.

20
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,500
Their CSR contributions often go from the companies to charitable entities also controlled by the families.

21
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:40,680
India’s largest company, Reliance Industries, for example, directed 94% of its 2019 contributions to the Reliance Foundation, chaired by Nita Ambani, the wife of Mukesh Ambani, Reliance’s largest shareholder and boss.

22
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,000
To its credit, Reliance discloses these contributions.

23
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,540
Many others are less forthcoming.

24
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,920
Where CSR money ultimately ends up is often unclear.

25
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,139
Some may flow into India’s political system.

26
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,500
Kitex is again the exception.

27
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:08,560
The company’s allied do-gooding arm is quite transparent about supporting political candidates and has spoken out about its efforts to do so in response to past government failures.

28
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,470
This, it would argue, is the socially responsible thing to do.
