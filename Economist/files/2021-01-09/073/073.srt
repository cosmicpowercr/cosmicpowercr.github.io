00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:24,330
LIKE MANY Chinese companies on the stockmarket, Gangtai Holding, a jewellery-to-property conglomerate, flaunts its listing.

2
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,929
It displays its ticker number, 600687, prominently on its website and in its ads.

3
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,790
But not for much longer.

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:43,130
On January 7th Gangtai began a 30-day period almost certain to end with its ejection from the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,829
It is one of a growing number of Chinese companies to face delisting at home.

6
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:57,590
In recent months all the delisting talk has been about the removal—or not— of Chinese companies from American exchanges (see article).

7
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:09,219
Within China, though, a potentially more important kind of delisting is on the agenda: regulators have made it easier to strip lousy firms of their listing status.

8
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:19,290
It is the latest in an array of reforms aimed at modernising the stockmarket, long seen more as a casino than an efficient allocator of capital.

9
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:26,500
Delistings are a staple of healthy stock exchanges, a mechanism for clearing out the dross.

10
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:35,150
In America a few dozen companies are typically forced off its exchanges every year, often because of low market values.

11
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,609
In the early 2000s, after the dotcom bust, annual delistings climbed to nearly 400.

12
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:54,570
China, by contrast, has averaged seven delistings a year over the past decade, despite having more than 4,000 listed companies, nearly as many as America.

13
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:03,430
Delistings have been so infrequent in China mainly because, relative to demand, listings themselves were hard to come by.

14
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:08,950
“Even if a company is nearly bankrupt, the shell value of being listed is really high.

15
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:15,280
Just by staying alive it can find a buyer,”says Lu Fangzhou of the University of Hong Kong.

16
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,379
This has made for perverse incentives.

17
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:30,020
Listed firms in financial trouble in China are classified as“special treatment”, abbreviated to ST before their ticker name, to warn off investors.

18
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,470
Instead, however, it is often an invitation to bid up their prices, as buyers might emerge.

19
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,140
ST stocks are volatile, but their returns have occasionally beaten the overall market (see chart).

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,240
That has recently begun to change.

21
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:53,149
Regulators relaxed controls over initial public offerings, paving the way for hundreds of new listings.

22
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,060
The value of being a shell diminished.

23
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:03,270
The delisting reform, introduced on the final day of2020, attacks the problem from the other end.

24
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:14,080
Companies with share prices below 1 yuan ($0,15) for 20 consecutive days will now face automatic delisting.

25
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:22,430
Those that fraudulently overstate their earnings by 100% for three years are on the chopping block, too.

26
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:31,490
The process will also become much faster, eliminating an intervening trading suspension—when troubled companies could find buyers.

27
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:36,540
China’s delistings could increase to about 50 a year.

28
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,050
Some investors complain the rules are still too lenient.

29
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:52,770
For example, Luckin Coffee, a Chinese would-be rival to Starbucks, was kicked off Nasdaq for fabricating transactions; in China its listing probably could have survived.

30
00:03:53,299 --> 00:04:01,460
But Zhou Maohua of China Everbright Bank counsels patience, saying the rules will be adjusted over time.

31
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,280
In Gangtai’s case, the company overstretched itself.

32
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:15,940
The gold-miner and jewellery-maker got pulled into property, even planning a skyscraper, and bought Buccellati, an Italian jeweller.

33
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,460
But as it racked up huge losses, it defaulted on bonds and sold its best assets.

34
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,839
Delisting is its latest humiliation.

35
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,740
At least it can console itself that it will soon have plenty of company.
