00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:34,499
BUOYED BY A growing economy, cheered by a domestic public united by the fight against covid-19, and eager to start shipping vaccines to friends around the world, China’s rulers feel history turning their way.

2
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,750
A recurring phrase in their speeches hails“changes unseen in a hundred years”.

3
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:52,200
Bluntly, Communist Party chiefs feel China is rising and democratic countries— battered by recession and racked by partisan disputes—are falling behind.

4
00:00:53,660 --> 00:01:04,799
As 2021 dawned, the European Union offered China a further boost by agreeing to a commercial pact that will bind some powerful European companies still more tightly to China.

5
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,929
The deal brushes aside concerns about dependence on Chinese markets.

6
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:22,330
It tackles allegations of forced labour in supply chains by accepting promises that China will make“continued and sustained efforts”to ratify international conventions on workers’ rights.

7
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:37,980
Politically, China sees the deal—a comprehensive investment agreement whose benefits mostly flow to a few German carmakers, European insurance companies and other well-connected firms—as an early victory over Joe Biden.

8
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:48,590
Aides to America’s president-elect had hinted publicly that Europe might like to wait and co-ordinate efforts to curb China’s worst trade and human-rights abuses.

9
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,570
Those hints were ignored.

10
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,790
Hosting EU ambassadors for lunch just before Christmas, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, praised Europe’s“strategic autonomy”.

11
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,759
The phrase was first dreamed up by French politicians.

12
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,489
Mr Wang’s use of it sent a clear message.

13
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:31,430
As envoys at the lunch tell it, China was thanking the agreement’s main backers, notably Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, for refusing to join America in the one alliance that Chinese leaders fear: a global coalition of like-minded nations willing to exclude China from sensitive supply chains or to block investments, in defence of democratic norms and freedoms.

14
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,020
Critics accuse EU leaders of shocking naivety.

15
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:51,550
They were particularly dismayed when the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, claimed that the agreement promoted Europe’s“core values”, and that China’s vague commitments provided“a lever to eradicate forced labour”.

16
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,059
Actually, it is not fair to call European leaders naive about the investment accord.

17
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:07,830
Rather, their motives are a mix of self-interest, cynicism about Europe’s limited clout and pessimism about the prospects for joint action with Mr Biden’s America.

18
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,500
A European summarises the decision- making process:“We had an economic interest in concluding a deal.

19
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,730
The Chinese had a political interest in demonstrating that China is not isolated.

20
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,630
There was a perception we would get nothing more.”

21
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:33,720
Views among European ambassadors and business bosses in China have hardened noticeably as the country takes one illiberal turn after another under President Xi Jinping, an austere autocrat.

22
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,510
In particular, 2020 was a turning-point.

23
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,530
A new national-security law trampled on Hong Kong’s Western-style freedoms.

24
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,710
Chinese troops killed Indian soldiers in a border clash.

25
00:03:52,119 --> 00:04:05,220
Intent on smothering discussions of China’s disastrous early handling of covid-19, Chinese diplomats threatened governments across the West, and were praised at home as patriotic“wolf warriors”.

26
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:13,520
China banned many Australian imports to punish that country for suggesting an independent probe into the pandemic’s origins.

27
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:25,679
Early in 2019 the EU published a strikingly honest China strategy, calling the country a partner, a competitor but also a“systemic rival”.

28
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:33,040
Among Europeans charged with managing relations with China, that tripartite view of China has not changed.

29
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:42,409
The investment agreement is best understood as a holdover from a time when Europe was unwilling to acknowledge deep ideological differences with China.

30
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,370
The EU’s negotiating mandate for the deal dates from 2013.

31
00:04:47,850 --> 00:05:03,330
With its focus on market access and level playing fields, it sets out to manage China as a partner and competitor, says Reinhard Bütikofer, a German Green and chairman of the European Parliament’s delegation for relations with China.

32
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:10,630
“It almost completely ignores systemic rivalry,”he objects, speaking by Zoom from Berlin.

33
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:24,149
He expects the parliament, which must approve the pact, to seek stronger commitments on labour rights, notably in factories using workers from Xinjiang, a western region where Muslim minorities are governed with an iron fist.

34
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,800
Mr Bütikofer’s approach is increasingly popular among Western elected politicians.

35
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,050
It is a minority view among European bigwigs in China.

36
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:50,930
Most argue for trade talks that seek whatever concessions are going, then for separate efforts to press China into curbing its worst abuses, and, most important, for work at home on anti-subsidy measures and security- screening of investments.

37
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,330
China is not about to change: time to build better defences Chinese voices insist that clashes over values are not inevitable, at least when talking to foreigners.

38
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:09,280
Wang Yiwei, director of the EU studies centre at Renmin University, chides Americans for thinking like religious missionaries about engagement with China.

39
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:19,110
In contrast,“Europe is secular; it is not seeking to convert China to a multiparty system or a free press,”he asserts, approvingly.

40
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,440
European sources in Beijing ascribe China’s willingness to cut a deal, after much foot-dragging, to two factors.

41
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:37,450
First, to the belief of Liu He, a deputy prime minister in charge of economic policy, that some European competition is good for state-owned firms.

42
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,660
Second, to a decision by Mr Xi to do a deal before Mr Biden takes office.

43
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:51,289
Ask European envoys if the EU erred by agreeing to a deal now, and they are divided.

44
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,010
Some insist that Europe risked irrelevance if it had waited for a new American president.

45
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:02,170
They add that this modest accord does not preclude co-ordinated action later.

46
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:08,329
Others regret the decision to hand China a political win at Mr Biden’s expense.

47
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:16,049
Not one of the diplomats argues that Europe underestimated its leverage, and could have struck a better deal.

48
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:20,879
Among Westerners in Beijing, bleak realism predominates.

49
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:25,999
Mr Biden says he will rally the democratic world behind a new China strategy.

50
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,289
He has his work cut out.
