SUCCESS IN MANUFACTURING depends on physical things: creating the best product using the best equipment with components assembled in the most efficient way.

2
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:38,760
Success in the service economy is dependent on the human element: picking the right staff members and motivating them correctly.

3
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,990
If manufacturing is akin to science, then services are more like the arts.

4
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,879
Motivating people has an extra complexity.

5
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:54,039
Widgets do not know when they are being manipulated.

6
00:00:54,779 --> 00:01:02,750
Workers make connections with their colleagues, for social or work reasons, which the management might not have anticipated.

7
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:12,450
Marissa King is professor of organisational behaviour at the Yale School of Management, where she tries to make sense of these networks.

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,979
She attempts a classification in her new book,“Social Chemistry: Decoding The Elements of Human Connection”.

9
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:34,110
The term“networking”has developed unfortunate connotations, suggesting the kind of person who sucks up to senior staff and ignores colleagues who are unlikely to help them win promotion.

10
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:48,520
Ms King cites a study which found that two-thirds of newly promoted professionals were ambivalent about, or completely resistant to, thinking strategically about their social relationships.

11
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:57,710
From the point of view of productivity, the most important networks are those formed by employees from different parts of the company.

12
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,340
Diverse viewpoints should lead to greater creativity.

13
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,250
They are good for workers, too.

14
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:14,030
A study found that catching up with colleagues in different departments was linked to salary growth and employee satisfaction.

15
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:21,650
Some employers had the bright idea of encouraging this co-operation by moving to open-plan offices.

16
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:35,190
But research suggests that workers in open- plan layouts are less productive, less creative and less motivated than those in offices with a traditional, room-based design.

17
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,089
The quality of interactions is more important than the quantity.

18
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:48,850
The pandemic, by forcing many people to toil away at home, has probably corroded some of these co-operative arrangements.

19
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,379
Ms King says that people tend to construct three types of network.

20
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,570
“Expansionists”have a wide set of contacts but their relationships tend to be shallow.

21
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,140
“Conveners”have a small number of relationships, but these are more intense.

22
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,400
“Brokers”link people from different network types.

23
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,930
On the surface, this categorisation seems reasonable.

24
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:18,219
How useful is it?

25
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:22,670
Readers can take an online test (at assessyournetwork.

26
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,470
com) to see which category they fall into.

27
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,190
Bartleby did so and found (as he expected) that he did not fit into any of them.

28
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:49,989
Indeed, the author’s research shows that one in three people does not have a clearly defined style and 20-25% could be classed as mixed (for example, they are simultaneously brokers and expansionists).

29
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,390
In other words, more than half of people cannot be neatly categorised.

30
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:06,500
To add to the muddle, Ms King introduces sub-categories: co-operative brokers, arbitraging brokers, tortured brokers, and so on.

31
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:19,990
Some people move from one category to another (like a certain Heidi Roizen, who, in a feat of management jargon,“transitioned from an expansionist to a broker to aconvening nucleus”).

32
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:29,100
At this point it seems wiser to admit that, to use an old phrase from the north of England,“there’s nowt so queer as folk”.

33
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:40,240
Fortunately, the book is full of wisdom and entertaining anecdotes which show that stories can give more insight than attempts at scientific categorisation.

34
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:49,060
Two fun case studies outline a common problem—the tendency for people to have too narrow a focus.

35
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:58,910
In one test, only one in four mobile-phone users noticed a clown who unicycled past them while they were looking at their screens.

36
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,250
In another revealing story, Catholic seminarians strode past a distressed bystander while in a hurry to give a lecture on the parable of the good Samaritan.

37
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,340
In the right network, the presence of a diverse set of participants may allow the group to see the bigger picture.

38
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,599
Old-fashioned concepts like courtesy can also help, Ms King argues.

39
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:31,840
Simple gestures—a smile, a thank you—make colleagues more likeable and increase co-operation.

40
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:43,039
In contrast, studies of workers who experience incivility find that their effort, time spent at work and commitment to the job all reduce.

41
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:51,820
Ms King invokes the aphorism that“assholes”can be identified by observing how they treat people with less power.

42
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:56,680
“Don’t be an asshole”is not a scientific statement.

43
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,970
But it is still a pretty good management motto.
