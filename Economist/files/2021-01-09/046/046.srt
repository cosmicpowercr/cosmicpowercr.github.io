1
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,520
TALK TO ONE of the 4m or so Europeans in Britain, and they will probably tell you the same story.

2
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:34,539
They intended to stay for a year or so—long enough to study, polish their English or save up for a better life back home.

3
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,910
And then, somehow, one year became two, which became 20.

4
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:46,900
Maria Torrent- March came from Spain on the Erasmus programme, as part of her five-year degree.

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,950
In the kitchen of her student lodgings, she met an English fellow student; soon they were dating.

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,610
“Do I go back to Spain, or do I give the boy a chance?”

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,130
She chose the boy.

8
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:05,490
After Britain voted to leave the European Union, many commentators predicted a“Brexodus”.

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:21,240
Since Brexit would end free movement, dampen the economic rationale for staying in Britain and had in part been driven by anti- immigration sentiment, might not many Europeans up sticks just as easily as they had come?

10
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,370
For the most part, that has not happened.

11
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:39,759
Although the pace of outflows has quickened a lot since the referendum (see chart), at least until the end of 2019—after which covid-19 makes migration data messy—more people were arriving in Britain than were leaving.

12
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:49,930
The number of European nationals living in Britain rose from 3,2m in 2015 to 3,6m in 2019.

13
00:01:51,180 --> 00:02:03,049
The government’s EU settlement scheme has received 4,4m applications, including one from Ms Torrent-March, who married“the boy”; they now have two daughters.

14
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:15,710
Though some applications will have been filed by migrants who have since left or as an insurance policy by Europeans with no current plan to live in Britain, the numbers hardly point to a Brexodus.

15
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,289
Nor are most poised to leave at any moment, should Brexit bear out the direst predictions.

16
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:33,100
The longer a migrant stays in a country, the less likely they are to leave, points out Madeleine Sumption of Oxford University’s Migration Observatory.

17
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:40,730
By 2019, a little more than half of EU nationals had lived in Britain for a decade or more.

18
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,260
They may have arrived footloose, but young migrants have a habit of growing older.

19
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:57,949
In those ten years, some will have found good jobs, others will have earned British qualifications, got married or had children—all of which strengthened their ties to Britain.

20
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,670
“I think most of these people will stay here for ever,”Ms Sumption says.

21
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:32,659
This suggests that, long after the last stars have worn off plaques on EU- funded projects, Europeans themselves will remain one of the most tangible legacies of Britain’s 47 years in the European club, just as several generations of Britons with Caribbean or Asian ancestry are reminders of a long-dead empire and the brief period of unrestricted immigration that flourished at its end.

22
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:42,050
In time, a comfortable European-British identity may emerge, says Sunder Katwala of British Future, a think-tank.

23
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:57,040
Schools are already accustomed to enrolling children with at least one European parent; some 730,000 were born to European mothers in England and Wales in 2008-19.

24
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:05,060
Births have slowed since the referendum, but Polish women still head the league table of foreign-born mothers.

25
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:16,330
In another generation, children with two British-born parents may talk of having a Polish grandfather in the same way many are proud of their Irish heritage.

26
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:24,600
This will not only be true of big cities, but also, albeit to a lesser extent, of towns and rural areas (see map).

27
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:33,190
Every local authority in Britain has been listed as a residence in at least several dozen settled-status applications.

28
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,910
Even the Isles of Scilly have a band of Poles and Hungarians.

29
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:53,480
Poles are particularly dispersed: they filed more than 500 applications in 298 of the 379 local authorities, compared with the 58 which saw 500 or more French applications.

30
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:02,179
Consider Corby, a town in Northamptonshire once synonymous with unemployment after the closure of its steelworks.

31
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:11,480
More than 3,000 Poles have registered to stay put, out of the town’s total population of 72,000.

32
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,660
Corby is now a popular home for logistics firms, which favour it for its central location and ready supply of labour.

33
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,940
Ms Torrent-March runs operations at Europa, one of the firms with a big warehouse in the town.

34
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:35,690
Of her 199 employees, 113 are European, a share that has not dwindled since the referendum.

35
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:42,890
EU migrants make up 24% of the town’s population—the largest share in Britain.

36
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:54,410
On the second floor of a grey shopping parade in the town, there is now a Polish private medical practice managed by Maciej Kuzma and his partner, Anna.

37
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,610
They both worked in a warehouse when they moved to Britain, seven years ago.

38
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:07,580
But they soon found more lucrative jobs and saved enough to buy the surgery in 2017, undeterred by the referendum result.

39
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:17,419
“The information about Brexit was surprising, but it wasn’t something that would stop us realising our plans, our dreams,”says Mr Kuzma.

40
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:19,670
“Polish history is very rich.

41
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,010
We’ve had an extremely hard past.

42
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,400
Maybe we’ve just got used to being forced to adapt.”

43
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:32,419
They now have 13,000 patients on their books and opened their second practice last year.

44
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,940
But London is always likely to have the greatest number of Europeans.

45
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:46,940
The posh borough of Kensington and Chelsea alone was listed in more than 5,000 applications each by French and Italian nationals.

46
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,420
The borough’s Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle remains popular with French parents.

47
00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:03,859
One of them, Caroline le Luel, moved from Paris in 2005 with her four-year-old daughter and two-year-old son; in time, she enrolled both of them at the Lycée.

48
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:08,880
Her son is now in his final year and her daughter is at university.

49
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:15,350
Even though they were educated at a French school,“they feel outsiders a bit when they are in France.

50
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,250
I don’t think they will settle down there at some point.”

51
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:27,469
That helps explain why the family applied for citizenship after Brexit, despite finding the vote“very emotional”.

52
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:32,440
“We are out of Europe, but people have settled their lives here,”she says.

53
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,090
“We don’t see the United Kingdom as as much of a cool place as it used to be, but we still want to stay here.

54
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,849
This is our home.”
