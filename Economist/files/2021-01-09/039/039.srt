00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,740
GIBRALTAR IS“a perfect synthesis of Britishness and the Mediterranean way of life”, boasts Fabian Picardo, its chief minister.

2
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:35,390
It has red telephone boxes and a Marks & Spencer, but its 34,000 people often lapse into Llanito, a kind of Spanglish, and their daily lives are intertwined with Spain’s.

3
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,760
No wonder that 96% of them voted in the referendum in 2016 for Britain to stay in the EU.

4
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:53,520
On December 31st Gibraltar got some consolation for Brexit in the form of an agreement that softens what is now a hard border.

5
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,220
It was a victory for common sense.

6
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,790
Gibraltar’s economy turns on services: finance, online gambling and tourism.

7
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,050
It exports few goods.

8
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:15,980
But it depends on some 10,000 workers who cross each day from Spain, and relies on its Spanish hinterland for space for homes and business expansion.

9
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,130
The agreement aspires to freedom of travel between the Rock and Spain.

10
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:31,500
A corollary is that Gibraltar’s airport and port will be the external border of the EU and will fall within the Schengen passport-free area.

11
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:45,010
Arriving passengers, including Britons, will have theirpassports checked first by Gibraltar’s police and then by Frontex, the EU’s border agency, working in conjunction with Spanish police.

12
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:55,800
Many details are still to be hammered out before this outline agreement becomes—later this year, diplomats hope—a treaty between the EU and Britain.

13
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,300
It involves delicate fudges.

14
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:05,580
Spain has long claimed sovereignty over Gibraltar, though it yielded it in the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,710
In a referendum in 2002 Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain British.

16
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,560
Some Spanish right-wingers saw Brexit as a chance to push for sovereignty.

17
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:26,660
But the biggest losers from confrontation would be the Spanish towns in the Rock’s hinterland, some of the poorest in Spain.

18
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:35,369
In La Línea, for example, unemployment is already 27% and drug-traffickers are powerful.

19
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:39,530
Until the treaty is signed, the hard border will be lightly enforced.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,690
With Gibraltar and La Línea both locked down because of covid-19, there is little traffic at the moment.

21
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,970
“This deal will have many enemies,”warns a diplomat.

22
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,439
But if it sticks, both sides have much to gain.

23
00:02:55,059 --> 00:03:07,490
Mr Picardo talks of a“bay of prosperity”where investors see enough certainty to take advantage of the Gibraltar region’s strategic position close to north Africa.
