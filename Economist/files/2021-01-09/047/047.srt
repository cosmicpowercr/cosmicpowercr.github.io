00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:26,110
THE VIEW from white cliffs of Dover has little changed in decades: a grey sea, gulls overhead and the coast of France on the horizon.

2
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,479
On January 1st that bracing vista became a Rorschach test for Brexit.

3
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,850
A Leave voter may have seen an ocean of opportunity, and a new dawn for Britain.

4
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,970
A Remainer might have wistfully seen an island cut adrift, and the sunset of British influence.

5
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,870
Declinism is rampant in Britain.

6
00:00:51,549 --> 00:01:06,390
Some 65% of Britons think the country is“in decline”, according to a poll conducted by Ipsos MORI for The Economist, while 57% think today’s youth will have a worse life than their parents.

7
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,610
But gloom is unevenly distributed.

8
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:18,890
Remainers are more likely to think Britain is in decline than Leavers, by 76% to 54%.

9
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,400
Labour voters are far more declinist than Tories.

10
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:34,010
Declinism, the gnawing belief in Britain’s economic and strategic eclipse, was the most powerful idea of post-war politics.

11
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,930
The task of escaping itconsumed left and right in turn.

12
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:48,710
It powered Harold Wilson’s“white heat of technology”in the 1960s, and Margaret Thatcher’s free-market revolution in the 80s.

13
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Correlli Barnett, a military historian who influenced Thatcher, thought the problem was that the elite went soft in the 19th century.

14
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:09,410
Anthony Sampson, an anatomist of Britain, blamed Britain’s rule by public-school bluffers instead of scientifically minded technocrats.

15
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:17,700
Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s now-departed chief adviser, took much the same view 50 years later.

16
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:26,510
Declinism drove Britain into Europe, as it watched the rapid recoveries of Italy, France and Germany with nervous envy.

17
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:37,050
The continent meant modernity,“La Dolce Vita”and the Citroën DS; Britons had“Carry on Camping”and the Vauxhall Victor.

18
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:47,810
Outside the European Economic Community, Britain would be a“greater Sweden”, isolated and irrelevant, said Con O’Neill, Britain’s negotiator.

19
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,300
Declinism drove Britain out again.

20
00:02:53,559 --> 00:03:02,680
Brexiteers saw Europe as a cosy retirement home for geriatric economies; Britain needed to throw the blanket from its knees and go dancing.

21
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,150
Now, the pro-Europeans are declinists again.

22
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,050
They have good reason for gloom.

23
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:21,260
Brexit cuts Britain’s long-term growth potential, reduces its influence in Brussels and Washington, and strains the bonds of the United Kingdom.

24
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:29,020
Leaving Erasmus, the student exchangeprogramme, is an act of self-inflicted drabness.

25
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:38,590
“Which is the more likely, I’m asking myself: that we lose Scotland, or that we rejoin before we’ve lost Scotland?”

26
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:45,650
says Michael Heseltine, a former Tory deputy prime minister, who thinks Brexit is a disaster.

27
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,240
Mr Johnson is popular because he is an anti-declinist.

28
00:03:51,630 --> 00:04:03,699
“The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts,”he declared on the steps of Downing Street after taking office, which he won on a promise to end the humiliating Brexit impasse.

29
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:16,120
The history of modern Britain, he later said, is of defying those who think that“our time as a nation has passed, that we should be content with mediocrity and managed decline”.

30
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,570
For those expecting a British comeback, this year may provide plenty to cheer.

31
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,590
Britain could be the first big country to vaccinate all at serious risk from covid-19.

32
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,820
Lifting restrictions should give the economy a boost.

33
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:46,439
Mr Johnson will host the G7 meeting later this year and the COP26 climate summit in November, offering him the chance to declare that Britain remains at the top table.

34
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:55,740
But declinism is not just a harmless national pastime, played by different people depending on who is in power.

35
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,859
It distorts the way a country sees itself.

36
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:11,880
Since Britain’s status is bound to slip in a world in which poor countries are getting richer, efforts to buck declinism are inevitably followed by disappointment.

37
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,220
Britain appeared to be falling behind in the 1960s because the rest of Europe was catching up.

38
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:27,640
And it is dangerous, too, for it encourages the impulsive behaviour of a man fleeing a ghost in a horror movie.

39
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,360
That leads to bad decisions—such as, for instance, leaving the EU.
