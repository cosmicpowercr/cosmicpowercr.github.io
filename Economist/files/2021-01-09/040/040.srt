00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:27,510
GREECE RANKS at or near the bottom of the EU class on digitisation, whether you measure it by high-speed internet connections, ownership of laptops and tablets, or online shopping.

2
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:39,700
The government’s digital- transformation“bible”, a scheme to catch up with European peers by 2025, which includes 400 separate projects, is months behind schedule.

3
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:52,360
Yet the country’s second lockdown in November (now set to last until at least January 11th) has spurred an unexpected leap forward in one important area: distance learning.

4
00:00:53,119 --> 00:01:04,490
Under a new law passed in the summer, schoolteachers can be required to hold all classes online, from pre-school nurseries to sixth forms preparing for university-entrance exams.

5
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:13,710
When the spread of coronavirus shut down schools across the country in March, maths and science teachers had little difficulty moving lessons online.

6
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,640
But some history and literature specialists without digital skills refused to co-operate.

7
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:39,670
“Now distance learning is mandatory and a new curriculum is being rolled out online,”says Niki Kerameus, the no-nonsense education minister in the right-of-centre government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, which took office in 2019 after four years of rule by the radical left-wing Syriza party.

8
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,360
Teachers who fail to show up for an online class face disciplinary action.

9
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:57,430
Ms Kerameus, a high-flying New York lawyer before she entered politics, says that Greek schools had only 4,500 portable devices when the government came to power last year.

10
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:07,150
Now more than 90,000 tablets and laptops have been handed out, paid for by EU funds, local government and private donations.

11
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,030
Cisco, a telecoms-equipment company, set up a Webex platform which can provide simultaneous access for the country’s 1,4m pupils and 180,000 teachers.

12
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:26,250
Teachers have attended online training sessions; some began Facebook groups to provide continuous tech support.

13
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:34,830
Even when normal life resumes in classrooms, digital learning will remain a big part of the syllabus, Ms Kerameus says.

14
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,599
Schools shut down again in November after a second coronavirus wave hit Greece.

15
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,480
The new online teaching system went live two days later.

16
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:53,040
When a chaotic first session triggered a social-media storm of protests from angry parents, glitches were quickly smoothed out.

17
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:05,790
“We’re feeling very encouraged,”says Eleni Hatzi, deputy head of a secondary school that serves Greece’s Muslim minority in Thrace, an impoverished region close to the border with Turkey.

18
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:14,760
“We have a record number of students taking university entrance this year and they have many new resources because of the digital programme.”

19
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:27,190
A pilot pre-school programme for four- to six-year-olds launched in 2019 in Larisa, in central Greece, can now continue digitally with the help of parents, despite the lockdown.

20
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,229
Stella Boura, who runs it, says her pupils are enjoying distance learning.

21
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,340
“They feel comfortable because they can interact with their teacher as usual.

22
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,160
They’re keeping up with early-learning English classes, shopping games and singing.”

23
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:52,190
Ms Kerameus admits that her task of keeping education on track during the pandemic was made easier because of Greece’s old-fashioned centralised school system.

24
00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:00,740
At present the education ministry keeps a tight grip on everything, from details of the curriculum to timetables and even schoolexcursions.

25
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,680
“Our aim is to decentralise the system,”she says.

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,499
“But right now [the old system] has actually been a help.”
