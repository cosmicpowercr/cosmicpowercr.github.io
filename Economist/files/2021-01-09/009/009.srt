1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,100
THE WORLD’S democracies desperately need a coherent approach to dealing with China.

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:34,840
It is the 21st century’s ascendant power, but also an autocracy that mistrusts free markets and abuses human rights.

3
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:41,110
However, recent events show how ineffective Western policy has become.

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:52,300
On December 30th the European Union agreed on an investment pact with China that secured puny gains and gave China a diplomatic coup.

5
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:05,269
New York’s stock exchange banned several Chinese firms’ shares, only to change its mind twice in a few days.

6
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,790
As the West stumbles, China is busy cracking down at home and expanding its influence abroad.

7
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:35,290
In November China signed a trade pact with 14 Asian countries, including American allies such as Japan andSingapore.

8
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:42,309
It continues to threaten Australia with its thuggish diplomacy and a partial trade embargo.

9
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:48,889
The pattern of Chinese assertiveness and Western disarray has become all too familiar.

10
00:01:49,550 --> 00:02:01,090
All democracies are struggling to reconcile the conflicting objectives of doing business with a huge and vibrant economy, and protecting national security and human rights (see Chaguan).

11
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:12,310
The Trump administration skewered Western complacency about China’s state-led model, but then detonated the global trading system without proposing an alternative.

12
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,400
Rich countries have failed to act together, reducing their clout.

13
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:35,760
America’s negotiators identified structural reforms that China should enact, and that other Western powers might have supported, but in the end President Donald Trump won only small concessions in the“phase one”trade agreement struck with China in January 2020.

14
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,839
Western policy has become a muddle of deals, rebukes, ad hoc bans and tariffs.

15
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:55,300
The system of rules that has been the backbone of global commerce for decades—featuring open trade and capital markets, and impartial legal systems—thrived because it was predictable.

16
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,600
Not any more.

17
00:02:57,089 --> 00:03:07,810
China is exploiting the disarray even as its economy comes roaring back from the pandemic: year-on-year growth was 4,9% in the most recent quarter.

18
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:17,160
Beijing’s rulers expect Mr Biden’s administration to be preoccupied with America’s troubles at home, not least covid-19.

19
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:31,349
Europe has welcomed Mr Biden’s conciliatory noises, but worries that his policies are laced with protectionism, including“Buy American”clauses and ambiguity over whether tariffs will be removed.

20
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:40,590
Faced with an introspective superpower, the EU decided to speed up its long-standing effort to strike an investment deal with China.

21
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,920
When it acts in isolation, however, it doesn’t have much sway.

22
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:56,140
The new deal features assurances over Chinese state meddling in industry that will be tricky to enforce and platitudes on human rights that China will ignore.

23
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,080
What might a coherent policy look like?

24
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,600
It has to start by acknowledging China’s power.

25
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,650
Unlike the Soviet Union, China is too big and interconnected to contain.

26
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:20,539
It is the largest merchandise trading partner of 64 countries, including Germany (see article).

27
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,200
America’s tally is just 38.

28
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:26,730
Chinese capital markets are becoming important, too.

29
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:30,780
Foreigners now own up to 10% of all government bonds.

30
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,600
Yet for all China’s size and sophistication, relations will remain riven with mistrust.

31
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,780
It is hard for outsiders to tell if private firms are acting independently of the Communist Party.

32
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:53,010
And it is foolhardy to rely on Chinese government promises, whether on subsidies for industry or the rule of law in Hong Kong.

33
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:07,000
The result is that in some domains the West should seek to confront China (human rights), while in others it should compete (most areas of trade) or co- operate (health and climate change).

34
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:15,440
The sheer complexity of trading without trust amplifies the need for the West to act in unison to maximise its influence.

35
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:23,220
Together, America, Europe and other democracies still account for over half of world GDP.

36
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:32,220
In order to limit the perimeter of trade tensions, they should define sensitive industries, such as technology and defence.

37
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:40,740
In these areas they should subject Chinese participation in Western markets to much tighter scrutiny and restrictions.

38
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:44,340
In other industries trade can flourish unhindered.

39
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:56,040
Democracies should draw up a common framework for human rights, including verifying that supplychains are ethical and penalising people and firms involved in abuses.

40
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,620
Finally, any new alliance to deal with China has to have predictable rules and enforcement.

41
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,180
It cannot be run from the White House on the fly.

42
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:19,010
Even before Europe’s snub this was a daunting task for the incoming Biden administration, on a par with the creation of NATO or the world trading system after the second world war.

43
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,650
And unlike back then, America’s prestige has been battered.

44
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,070
Yet public opinion in the rich world is now wary of China.

45
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,260
Mr Trump failed to deal with it partly because of his incompetence and contempt for allies.

46
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:39,250
Mr Biden will take office on January 20th on a wave of global goodwill.

47
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,880
It should be possible to create a grouping of democracies, for example an enlarged G7, that will act on China.

48
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:55,840
There is a still a chance to reassert the values of open societies and free markets, but it will not last for ever.

49
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:02,090
Faced with an assertive autocracy, dithering and division are not enough.
