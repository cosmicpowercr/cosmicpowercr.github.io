00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:32,529
THE FIRST surge in the price of bitcoin, to around $1,000 in 2013, minted cryptocurrency millionaires, provoked declarations of a bubble and left some early fans kicking themselves.

2
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:46,820
One unlucky man in Wales searched a rubbish dump for a hard drive containing 7,500 accidentally discarded bitcoins, whose value had grown from almost nothing to $7,5m.

3
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,190
Since then bitcoin has been on a wild ride.

4
00:00:50,500 --> 00:01:02,620
Fuelled by casual speculators and market manipulation, its price surged to about $19,000 in December 2017; over the next year it fell by more than four-fifths.

5
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,170
Bitcoin’s most recent ascent has been its giddiest yet.

6
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:16,770
Having tripled in three months its price is now over $35,000 and somewhere under Newport sits a computer part worth over $260m.

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:27,119
Today’s bitcoin enthusiasm is striking because basement-dwelling libertarians are not the only ones talking it up.

8
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,740
Some of Wall Street’s finest have joined them (see article).

9
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:38,250
Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s largestasset manager, said in December that bitcoin could become a“global market”.

10
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,150
Big hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies have been punting on cryptocurrencies.

11
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:53,830
Ruchir Sharma, a strategist at Morgan Stanley’s investment arm, argues that America’s mounting debts may make cryptocurrencies more appealing.

12
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:04,690
The total value of outstanding bitcoins exceeds that of Canadian dollars, narrowly defined to include banknotes and central-bank reserves.

13
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:13,410
But few of the new crypto converts think it has any chance of replacing government money—the dream of early believers.

14
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:22,830
It is far too inefficient to be of much use for making payments; bitcoin is capable of processing fewer than ten transactions per second.

15
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:30,250
By contrast, the firms upending consumer finance, like Alipay and Venmo, minimise friction.

16
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:38,159
Were that problem solved, governments would clamp down quickly on any technology that threatened their monetary sovereignty.

17
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:49,550
Regulatory resistance has already forced Facebook’s mooted digital currency, Libra, to rebrand (to“Diem”) and scale back its early ambition.

18
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:57,969
Meanwhile, the competition is heating up as central banks improve payments systems and launch slick digital currencies of their own.

19
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:12,150
Bitcoin mania is instead rooted in the possibility that it might eventually offer a safe store of value—like gold, but more convenient (because it iseasier to maintain a digital wallet than a physical vault).

20
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,639
Then it could win a small but permanent slice of investors’ portfolios.

21
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,150
Like bitcoin, gold pays no interest or dividend.

22
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:33,949
Unlike bitcoin, gold has fundamental uses, but it is fluctuating demand from investors for the yellow metal, not jewellers and chipmakers, that drives prices.

23
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:40,220
It is therefore conceivable that bitcoin’s high price could also prove self-sustaining.

24
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:53,150
If bitcoin became as popular with investors as gold (measured by the market value of their positions) the price would rise to $146,000, calculates JPMorgan, a bank.

25
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:58,280
Already, millennial investors appear to prefer cryptocurrencies to bullion.

26
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,010
There are plenty of reasons to doubt that bitcoin can emulate gold.

27
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:10,290
Its price is much more volatile and moves with the stockmarket, which is hardly desirable for a supposed haven.

28
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:22,680
The market is illiquid and cryptocurrency trading remains a wild west in which fraud and theft are rampant, and which facilitates crimes such as selling drugs online.

29
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:30,099
Investors in cryptocurrencies must tolerate a large dose of financial and reputational risk.

30
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:40,140
Hedge funds, which thrive on dicey investments, may be piling in but the stolid end of Wall Street, which includes pension funds, is wary.

31
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,020
Yet it would be wrong to dismiss bitcoin’s surge out of hand.

32
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:57,330
Eventually, an accommodation with regulators, more liquid trading and clampdowns on criminal activity—the supposed anonymity of bitcoin is overstated—could give it a wide appeal.

33
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,559
Bitcoin was originally sold on the promise of upending the global monetary system.

34
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:07,800
Its success now hinges on finding a more modest role within it.
