00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:27,110
FROM A SMALL office in Montreal an artificial-intelligence business, Aquantix, plays sleuth for faraway investors worried about water risk.

2
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:35,370
Its model combines high-resolution satellite imagery, weather-station data and regulatory documents scraped from the internet.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:50,910
It estimates not only how much water a business uses at its various sites but its water bill, the chances of drought or flooding in surrounding areas and the financial impact such disasters could have—all without contacting the company in question.

4
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,570
Firms like Aquantix are proving useful to investors waking up to water risk.

5
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:05,850
At current rates of consumption, the demand for water worldwide will be 40% greater than its supply by 2030, according to the UN.

6
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:19,050
Portfolio managers are realising that physical, reputational and regulatory water risk could hurt their investments, particularly in thirsty industries such as food, mining, textiles and utilities.

7
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,750
One worry is that shocks to supply could drown or dry out a company’s assets.

8
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:30,970
In recent years Coca-Cola has been forced to close plants in Indiabecause of drought.

9
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:40,089
In 2019 floods in America’s Midwest caused disruptions at the facilities of two food giants, Cargill and Tyson Foods.

10
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:52,120
A survey by CDP, a non-profit firm, found that 783 big listed companies had faced a total of $40bn of water-related losses in 2018.

11
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,860
Another concern is that the price a company pays for water could rocket.

12
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,149
The market price of water does not reflect the environmental and social costs of using it.

13
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,260
Government subsidies also mean that companies often do not pay for its true cost.

14
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,780
As aquifers are depleted, though, subsidies could become more costly and unpopular, forcing governments to retract them.

15
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:30,280
S&P Global Trucost, a data provider, reckons that if Fortune 500 companies paid the true cost of water, based on estimates of scarcity, rather than current prices, their profit margins would shrink by a tenth.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,650
Margins for food, drink and tobacco firms would fall by three-quarters.

17
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,730
Disclosures of water risk are even patchier than those of greenhouse-gas emissions.

18
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,260
In part, that is because it is more difficult to measure.

19
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,679
Emitting a tonne of carbon dioxide in the Sahara or in London has the same environmental impact.

20
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,390
Using a gallon of water does not.

21
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,660
Place-specific data can be commercially sensitive and difficult to aggregate.

22
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,810
So businesses resort to vague global estimates instead.

23
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,560
Unlike emissions, however, water can be observed, and third-party data providers can have a crack at estimating a company’s water use.

24
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,160
Established names like Bloomberg and S&P Global are plugging the gap, as are startups.

25
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:27,940
The result, says Toby Messier, co-founder of Aquantix, is that investors can approach management armed with data rather than questions.

26
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,719
“We are getting rid of the black box that companies hide in,”he says.

27
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,189
Investors can turn to a range of new methods.

28
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,410
Some want a simple score to plug into a model.

29
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:47,310
Ceres, a non-profit firm, scores businesses on everything from direct water management to risks in the supply chain.

30
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:58,130
Those seeking more detail can use visual tools, such as Bloomberg’s“maps”function, which plots a company’s facilities over a heat map based on water stress.

31
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:05,420
(California is the same colour as swathes of sub-Saharan Africa; far-eastern Russia looks a lot like western Europe.

32
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,330
) Firms like Aquantix go further, and try to predict the financial cost of water risk.

33
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,460
The accuracy of such forecasts is not yet proven.

34
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,320
For Andrew Mason of Aberdeen Standard Investments, though, they are still useful.

35
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,030
They show companies that investors care about water risk and encourage them to share data.

36
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,769
“This is where carbon was ten or 15 years ago,”he says.
