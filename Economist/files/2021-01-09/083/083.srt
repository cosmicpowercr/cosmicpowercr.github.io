00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,890
The World Turned Upside Down.

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,130
By Yang Jisheng.

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:56,350
AS MOST PEOPLE understand it, the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76 was a period of unmitigated horror, a time when frenzied mobs unleashed by Mao Zedong ran amok across China, killing and torturing, ransacking homes, destroying religious sites and erasing much of the tangible heritage of one of the world’s great civilisations.

4
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,350
Yet it was far more complex than that.

5
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:05,110
The gangs of Red Guards involved in the violence were not part of a national organisation.

6
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:15,230
There were a myriad of them, their members exploiting a rare moment in the history of Communist rule in China when people were allowed to organise themselves spontaneously.

7
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:24,559
That is why, when pondering alternatives to autocracy, the Cultural Revolution weighs so heavily on the minds of some Chinese.

8
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:34,240
Were the party to loosen its grip,would China be engulfed in mayhem again, only this time without a Mao to reimpose order?

9
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:43,440
There has been no shortage of literature describing the suffering caused by the Cultural Revolution and the deep, still-painful wounds it inflicted.

10
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:50,340
Writers inside China, however, have been restrained by the party from exploring the politics of that period.

11
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:59,999
The party admits that the Cultural Revolution was a disaster, but it wants to preserve Mao’s image as Communist China’s hallowed founding father.

12
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:07,080
It blames the disorder largely on the chairman’s wife, Jiang Qing, and other members of the“Gang of Four”.

13
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:18,630
It does not want people to look too closely at the differences between Red Guard groups, nor at why former members of some of them have thrived in the post-Mao era.

14
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:26,040
Such taboos make Yang Jisheng’s“The World Turned Upside Down”a rarity.

15
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:34,370
The author is a retired journalist from the state news agency, Xinhua —a position that made him privy to the party’s inner workings.

16
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,280
But he is no stooge.

17
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:48,410
His earlier book,“Tombstone”, which described the famine caused by Mao’s Great Leap Forward of the late 1950s, was one of the most shocking accounts by an author in China of that calamity.

18
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:57,650
Like“Tombstone”, his latest work is banned in mainland China, though a Chinese-language edition was published in Hong Kong in 2016.

19
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:01,740
This new English translation is an abridged version.

20
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,690
For the non-specialist,“The World Turned Upside Down”is a challenging read.

21
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,979
It makes few concessions to those unfamiliar with the language and politics of the time.

22
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:21,760
People are sometimes introduced without reference to the post-Mao roles for which they are now known—and the endnotes do not always help.

23
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,600
The style is clunky and the narrative disjointed.

24
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:33,199
Long lists of attendees at meetings and other such encumbrances often give the book the feel of an official chronicle.

25
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,830
Yet Mr Yang’s argument is clear and important.

26
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:50,859
It is that many of the Red Guards were victims themselves, and that what motivated some of them was not a love of tyranny, but quite the opposite: the chance to wreak revenge on Communist bureaucrats who had been oppressing them.

27
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,560
Mr Yang describes the Cultural Revolution as a“triangular game”.

28
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:11,789
It involved Mao, the bureaucrats (and the“conservative”Red Guards they supported), and“rebel”Red Guards whom Mao tried to use to topple the bureaucrats blocking his Utopian—and destructive—plans for China’s social and economic transformation.

29
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,710
The winners were the bureaucrats and the Red Guards aligned with them.

30
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,350
They were the pragmatists who went on to rule China.

31
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,910
During the decade of the Cultural Revolution, the rebel faction was in the ascendancy for only about two years.

32
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,099
When it had the upper hand, it was“savage and cruel”, says Mr Yang.

33
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:34,680
But the savagery of the conservative Red Guards and their backers was worse.

34
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,090
Far more rebels were killed or persecuted than Red Guards from the other side.

35
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:52,050
After Deng Xiaoping became China’s de facto leader in 1978, he focused his sweeping purge of Cultural Revolution activists on them, not on the conservatives.

36
00:04:52,650 --> 00:05:00,079
Sadly—though sensibly for a writer who lives in China—Mr Yang does not examine the Red Guard backgrounds of current leaders.

37
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Xi Jinping, now president and party chief, was unable to join up because Mao had purged his father, a senior official.

38
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,260
As a teenager Mr Xi was detained by rebel Red Guards and forced to denounce his father.

39
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,059
Now he encourages reverence of Mao as a way of strengthening the party’s legitimacy.

40
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:28,360
But he is not heard repeating Mao’s belief that Marxism could be summed up in a sentence:“To rebel is justified.”

41
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:42,580
In Mr Yang’s telling, even Mao himself found that the genie of rebellion, once released, was“more than he himself could subdue”, and that corking it up again required the help of those he had wanted out of his way.

42
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:49,810
For Mao’s successors, including Mr Xi, ruling China has been about maintaining the status quo.

43
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,470
But in the long run, the party’s obsession with order may not work, either.

44
00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:01,410
Mr Yang predicts that eventually its“oppressive tactics”will cause an“unprecedented social explosion”.

45
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:09,370
He does not speculate on whether this might prove as bloody as the Cultural Revolution, when millions were killed or persecuted.

46
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,640
But even today, that fear endures.
