00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:29,490
LYING DRUNK in a field outside the Austrian city of Innsbruck in 1971, inspiration struck Douglas Adams, a science-fiction writer.

2
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:39,760
He looked at his copy of“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Europe”, and then up at the stars, and came up with the idea for a“Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”.

3
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:51,490
It would be a (fictional) mixture of travel book and encyclopedia, but with an absurd- seeming twist: instead of being written by experts, anyone could contribute.

4
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,820
Adams played his idea for laughs.

5
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,290
But today it looks as prescient as it was funny.

6
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:07,280
On January 15th Wikipedia—“the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit”—will celebrate its 20th anniversary.

7
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,500
It will do so as the biggest and most-read reference work ever.

8
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:19,950
Wikipedia hosts more than 55m articles in hundreds of languages, each written by volunteers.

9
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:28,069
Its 6,2m English- language articles alone would fill some 2,800 volumes in print.

10
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:38,550
AlexaInternet, a web-analysis firm, ranks Wikipedia as the 13th-most-popular site on the internet, ahead of Reddit, Netflix and Instagram.

11
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,840
Yet Wikipedia is an oddity.

12
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,960
It defies the Silicon Valley recipe for success.

13
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,080
The site has no shareholders, has generated no billionaires and sells no advertising.

14
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:07,580
Today’s aspiring tech giants burn vast quantities of investors’ money subsidising taxi rides (Uber) or millennial messaging (Snap) in pursuit of“scale”.

15
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:14,110
Wikipedia grew organically, as more and more ordinary people decided to contribute.

16
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:21,670
The site has its roots in the techno-optimism that characterised the internet at the end of the 20th century.

17
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:30,220
It held that ordinary people could use their computers as tools for liberation, education and enlightenment.

18
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:39,610
Like most Utopian thinking, the idea of an amateur encyclopedia was, for many years, treated as a bit of a joke.

19
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,870
“A few endorse Wikipedia heartily.

20
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,800
This mystifies me,”wrote a former president of the American Library Association in 2007.

21
00:02:50,730 --> 00:03:01,329
“A professor who encourages the use of Wikipedia is the intellectual equivalent of a dietician who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything,”he sneered.

22
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:19,639
Even now, after numerous academic studies highlighting its reliability, Wikipedia still lacks the gravitas and authority of older encyclopedias like“Britannica”, which are written by paid academic experts rather than amateurs.

23
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:27,340
Schools, universities and The Economist’s fact-checkers frown on relying on it.

24
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,510
Wikipedia may not have vanquished its doubters in theory.

25
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,859
But it has triumphed in practice.

26
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:43,290
With over 20bn page views a month, it has become the standard reference work for anyone with an internet connection.

27
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:54,139
As social-media sites are lambasted for censorship,“fake news”, disinformation and conspiracy theories, its reputation is higher than ever.

28
00:03:54,859 --> 00:04:08,819
Toby Negrin, chief product officer at the Wikimedia Foundation, the San Francisco-based charity that provides the site’s infrastructure, describes the online encyclopedia as a“guardian of truth”.

29
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,169
That sounds grandiose.

30
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,150
But other tech behemoths now use it as a neutral arbiter.

31
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,160
Conspiracy-theory videos on YouTube often come tagged with warning information from Wikipedia.

32
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:32,020
Since 2018 Facebook has used Wikipedia to provide information buttons with the sources of news articles.

33
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Others are also enthusiastic.

34
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:46,900
In October the World Health Organisation (WHO) started working with Wikipedia to make information on covid-19 available via the site.

35
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:55,010
It considered the collaboration vital to its efforts to prevent an“infodemic”of misinformation about the virus.

36
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:06,159
Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive, which preserves websites for posterity, describes Wikipedia as“a treasure of the internet”.

37
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,880
Wikipedia’s value and influence are hard to compute.

38
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,690
Its revenues come from charitable grants and donations from its users.

39
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:26,700
“Wikipedia is an example of what I like to call ‘digital dark matter’,”says Shane Greenstein, an economist at Harvard who has studied the site closely.

40
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:38,050
Like parenting and housework, contributing to it is a valuable service that, because it is unpaid, remains mostly invisible to standard economic tools.

41
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,609
A few researchers have tried to guess.

42
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:50,050
One study in 2018 estimated that American consumers put a value of about $150 a year on Wikipedia.

43
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:56,329
If true, the site would be worth around $42bn a year in America alone.

44
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,489
Then add indirect benefits.

45
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,140
Many firms use Wikipedia in profitable ways.

46
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:11,790
Amazon and Apple rely on it to allow Alexa and Siri, their voice assistants, to answer factual questions.

47
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,000
Google uses it to populate the“fact boxes”that often accompany searches based on factual questions.

48
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,060
Facebook has started to do something similar.

49
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,790
This drives traffic to Wikipedia from those keen to learn more.

50
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:34,999
AI language models of the sort employed by Google or Facebook need huge collections of text on which to train.

51
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,870
Wikipedia fits the bill nicely.

52
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,190
The cult of the amateur Its biggest power is its subtlest.

53
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:53,119
Since it is the first resort of students, professors, journalists and any number of curious people, its contributors do much to make the intellectual weather.

54
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:05,200
The WHO’s decision to work with Wikipedia reflects research suggesting that the site is the most-read source of medical information in the world—for doctors as well as patients.

55
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,639
Its reach is clearest when things go wrong.

56
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:19,630
In 2008 one user inserted a joke claiming that the South American coati, a small mammal, is sometimes known as the“Brazilian aardvark”.

57
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:32,830
By the time the jape was revealed, in 2014, it had found its way on to various websites and into news articles and a book published by a university press.

58
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:48,410
In 2012 a senior British judge wascaught out when, in a report on the shortcomings and criminality of parts of the British press, he named Brett Straub as one of the founders of the Independent, a newspaper.

59
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,710
Mr Straub has nothing to do with the Independent.

60
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,530
His friends had been adding his name to Wikipedia’s pages as a joke.

61
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:09,430
Yet despite a string of notable embarrassments—and its own disclaimer that“Wikipedia is not a reliable source”—it is, on the whole, fairly accurate.

62
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:22,649
An investigation by Nature in 2005 compared the site with“Britannica”, and found little difference in the number of errors that experts could find in a typical article.

63
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,280
Other studies, conducted since, have mostly endorsed that conclusion.

64
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,640
Explaining exactly why Wikipedia’s articles are so good is trickier.

65
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:40,109
A common joke holds that it is just as well that Wikipedia works in practice, because it does not work in theory.

66
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,070
Deliberate decisions are one explanation.

67
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:54,020
Wikipedia compares well with other reference works when it comes to honest mistakes, but it is uniquely vulnerable to vandalism and pranks.

68
00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:02,530
In an effort to combat them, says Mr Negrin, the site has developed algorithms that monitor articles for mischief.

69
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:13,870
For America’s recent presidential election, editing articles was restricted to accounts more than 30 days old, and with at least 500 edits to their name.

70
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:16,649
Other reasons are structural.

71
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:25,560
The site’s open nature and its popularity help ensure that errors in well-read articles are usually spotted and fixed quickly.

72
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:30,819
(By the same token, mistakes in more obscure entries may languish for years.

73
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:38,360
) Mr Greenstein notes that, unlike with a printed encyclopedia,“another paragraph doesn’t cost anything”.

74
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:46,850
That means that ideological rows can often be defused simply by adding paragraphs outlining different views.

75
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,230
The site’s intimidating list of rules means that new editors face a steep learning curve.

76
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,150
But it also helps to filter out dilettantes, ideologues and bores with an axe to grind.

77
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:14,890
Wikipedia’s not-for-profit structure, points out Mr Kahle, means it can focus on the interests of readers and editors without having to consider the (possibly conflicting) demands of advertisers.

78
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,250
The site is unusual since it is run by humans, not algorithms.

79
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:40,179
Though social-media sites rely on idiot- savant computer programs to maximise“engagement”(ie, to sell moreadvertising), Wikipedia’s humans try to uphold woolly ideals such as accuracy, impartiality and arguing in good faith.

80
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:47,269
Much of its success, in other words, is because of the culture its users have created.

81
00:10:47,889 --> 00:11:03,450
It is evident in the discussion pages that accompany every article, as the site’s contributors debate with each other the noteworthiness of a topic, the quality of its primary sources, what information to include and to leave out, and more.

82
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,919
Rules of thumb gradually become more solid guidelines.

83
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:18,550
The Wikipedia page outlining the“Neutral Point of View”—one of the most widely discussed and referred to—runs to 4,500 words.

84
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:28,450
It includes recommendations on how best to describe aesthetic opinions, which assumptions count as necessary, and which must be justified.

85
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,450
It also points out the risks of providing“false balance”about controversial subjects.

86
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,670
Cultures constantly change.

87
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,940
Relying on Wikipedia’s current one may, therefore, seem a risky strategy.

88
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:58,190
Katherine Maher, the Wikimedia Foundation’s executive director, says that if Wikipedia did not already exist it might not be possible to create it on today’s fragmented, commercially minded internet.

89
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:03,350
But given that it does, she is bullish about its prospects for survival.

90
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:11,889
Much of the site’s work appeals to human nature, she says:“People love to be right, to demonstrate their competence.”

91
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:14,850
Even errors can be helpful.

92
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:22,830
Ms Maher cites Cunningham’s Law, which holds that“the best way to get the right answer to a question on the internet.

93
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,840
is to post the wrong answer.”

94
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:42,730
She recalls meeting a committed Chinese editor who began contributing to the Chinese-language project because“a lot of what he saw was just wrong, and he felt he had to fix it!”Keeping Wikipedia’s culture healthy means moving with the times.

95
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,330
“Wikipedia is a child of the desktop internet,”says Mr Negrin.

96
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:54,369
But“increasingly, when people talk about internet users, they’re talking about smartphones.”

97
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,660
So the foundation is improving the site’s mobile-editing tools.

98
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:12,960
Typing long articles on a smartphone is inescapably awkward, so attention has focused on helping users to make“micro-edits”, such as fixing spelling mistakes or correcting dates.

99
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:25,660
The hope is that this will also act as a gateway drug for young editors and for those in poorer countries for whom smartphones are the standard or only way of getting online.

100
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:32,610
Attracting a steady supply of new editors is vital for Wikipedia’s long-term survival.

101
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,080
So is attracting new kinds of contributors.

102
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,040
The encyclopedia itself is popular in America, Europe, Russia and Japan, but not much read in India and sub- Saharan Africa (see chart).

103
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,509
Changing that, she says, is vital to the health of a project whose idealism remains undimmed.

104
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:10,570
“Our vision is a world where every single human being can share in all knowledge,”she says.

105
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,030
This time, such Utopianism is harder to dismiss.

106
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,810
After all, it is backed up by 20 years of success.
