00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:34,610
WHEN KIM JONG UN, North Korea’s third-generation despot, penned a short, bland greeting to his people to run as a splash in the year’s first edition of the state mouthpiece, Rodong Sinmun, it triggered an avalanche of speculation among Pyongyangologists—over what Mr Kim did not do.

2
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:46,500
Since the founding of the communist state, a near-annual staple has been a prolix new year’s address by the country’s leader, trumpeting the regime’s accomplishments and the glories to come.

3
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:54,730
Like Chinese emperors conducting Confucian rites, the address confirmed the Kims at the summit of a divinely ordained order.

4
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:03,030
Unlike his father and grandfather before him, Mr Kim, in power since 2011, has typically delivered the speech in person.

5
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:10,030
Yet last year he simply published a long screed, and this year there was no paean at all.

6
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:19,590
Perhaps Mr Kim was keeping his powder dry for an important congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, only the second since 1980?

7
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:26,230
Thatopaque conclave duly opened on January 5th—without any ritual address from the leader.

8
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,270
In its place was a bald admission of failure.

9
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:41,169
The goals of his country’s five-year economic plan, launched in 2016 and promising sunlit uplands, were, Mr Kim admitted,“immensely underachieved in almost all sectors”.

10
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:48,029
Although the Kim dynasty is founded upon myth and mendacity, he could not have easily dissembled.

11
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,990
Last year’s economic outcomes in an already broken country were dire.

12
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,320
Trade collapsed by an estimated 80% (just $1,6m of goods officially crossed the border with China in October).

13
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:09,140
The informal markets and private enterprise upon which millions of North Koreans now depend have struggled to fill the gap.

14
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,450
Shortages are growing, with the prices of vegetables and fruit rising sharply.

15
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:25,420
Even upscale supermarkets in Pyongyang, the pampered capital, have run out of sugar, cooking oil and toothpaste, according to NK News, a website based in Seoul.

16
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:34,270
Closing the borders in early 2020 in response to the covid-19 pandemic came on top of North Korea’s diplomatic isolation.

17
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,930
For both acts of self- harm, the blame lies squarely with Mr Kim.

18
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:44,460
He calculated that provocative missile and nuclear tests would force America to negotiate.

19
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:52,299
For a time this strategy seemed as if it might work on President Donald Trump, who expressed admiration for the North Korean ruler.

20
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,490
But Mr Kim overplayed his hand.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,630
Talks failed, and sanctions were only tightened.

22
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:04,540
Perhaps Mr Kim hoped that a second term for Mr Trump could get the personal chemistry fizzing again.

23
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,970
Instead, he faces a level-headed Joe Biden.

24
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:19,670
As for the coronavirus, Mr Kim saw it as a threat to his regime and shut the crucial border with China—border guards even shot at storks suspected of carrying the virus.

25
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,820
The country’s decrepit health system could surely not handle a pandemic.

26
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:40,350
Meanwhile, as Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein points out on the Australian National University’s East Asia Forum, admitting foreign epidemiologists would have opened the country to the risk of foreign spies and unsavoury ideological influences.

27
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,580
But this extreme response comes at an immense human cost.

28
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:52,560
The economy, says Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul, seems to be“beginning to fall apart”.

29
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,660
Hunger once again stalks the land.

30
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:04,419
If he cared about his people, Mr Kim would welcome foreign vaccines, even if outsiders helped distribute and administer them.

31
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:17,530
The party congress would also initiate the kind of market reforms that set communist China and Vietnam on the path of growth (and which North Korea briefly appeared tempted to embark on early in Mr Kim’s rule).

32
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:25,969
Far more likely, the congress will herald a new era of state control over private enterprise, harming livelihoods even more.

33
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:37,070
Mr Lankov reckons the regime faces its greatest test since a famine more than 20 years ago brought on by the incompetence of Mr Kim’s late father and grandfather.

34
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,260
The regime survived that test despite the deaths of more than 500,000 North Koreans.

35
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,660
Today, though, the people know much more about the outside world.

36
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,360
They have grown less deferential to authority.

37
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:56,590
And they are used to coping without the state: they might react angrily to the reimposition of central control.

38
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,150
That is not to say that the Kim dynasty is on the brink of collapse.

39
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,840
But even small disturbances may be seen, both at home and abroad, as a sign of unravelling.

40
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:17,960
The regime’s rituals project Mr Kim—morbidly obese, smoking heavily and cosseted in his palaces—as the irreproachable bearer of a heavenly mandate.

41
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:22,250
It is a message he may soon need to reinforce.
