00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:28,120
THE HEADY years after apartheid gave rise to what advertisers and the press called“black diamonds”.

2
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:39,880
Portrayals of newly rich black South Africans were often crass, highlighting their flashy cars and fancy homes that had been out of reach in the era of white rule.

3
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,430
Many of the gaudiest examples involved people close to the ruling African National Congress (ANC).

4
00:00:48,910 --> 00:01:08,250
In 2010 Kenny Kunene, a businessman and convicted fraudster who later starred in“So What: Big Money, Big Dreams”, a TV show, was criticised for spending 700,000 rand (then worth $47,000) on a party where he ate sushi off scantily clad women.

5
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,059
His response:“It cost more than that.”

6
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:15,480
Such tales were entertaining, but they were not the norm.

7
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:28,819
More representative of the milieu of middle-class black South Africans is the Reeds, a suburb in Centurion, near Pretoria, full of Toyotas and modest homes roofed with terracotta tiles.

8
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:39,829
Under apartheid its position near the administrative capital made it popular among Afrikaners (whites of mainlyDutch descent) with government jobs.

9
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:50,740
Today it is mostly home to black South Africans, who joined the public sector en masse after the first democratic elections in 1994.

10
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:57,800
Shortly after that vote Ayanda (not her real name) and her husband got good jobs in the civil service.

11
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:02,160
In 1995 they moved to the Reeds with their two children.

12
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,449
They were the first black family on the street.

13
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:12,070
Her white neighbours were initially hostile, but“we were just so happy to have our own house,”she says.

14
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,459
“We’re here in the suburbs because of the ANC.”

15
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,570
That kind of loyalty may soon be tested.

16
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,800
South Africa is in a fiscal crisis.

17
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:37,210
The share of public debt to GDP has risen from 22% in 2008-09 to an estimated 82% in the current fiscal year, 2020-21.

18
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:43,780
The treasury forecasts a deficit of 15% of GDP.

19
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,790
The share of tax revenues spent on servicing debts was 10% in 2010.

20
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,080
It was about 22% in 2020, and will keep rising.

21
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:04,950
The pandemic brought forward the reckoning, but the more important causes were a decade of slow growth and reckless spending by the ruling party.

22
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:13,550
To try to close the deficit Tito Mboweni, the finance minister, is targeting the public-sector workforce.

23
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,520
South Africa does not have an especially large one, but it is well paid (see chart).

24
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:31,520
Public-sector pay went up by an average of two-thirds in real terms between the fiscal years ending in 2007 and 2019,far faster than the rise in the private sector.

25
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:44,270
Mr Mboweni has proposed cutting the public payroll by 160bn rand (25% of the total in 2019-20) over“the medium term”.

26
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:55,480
It is the first salvo in a battle over the budget that will profoundly affect the country—and the ANC’s relations with the black middle class it helped to create.

27
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,800
South Africa’s black middle class predates democracy.

28
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:11,650
In the first half of the 20th century there was a smattering of black professionals, including mission-educated doctors, teachers and lawyers, such as Nelson Mandela.

29
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:20,870
In 1965 Leo Kuper, a sociologist, wrote“An African Bourgeoisie”about the middle class under apartheid.

30
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:33,800
From the late 1970s, as white rule began to unravel, the government made cursory efforts to encourage the growth of a black bourgeoisie that might dampen the ANC’s revolutionary fervour.

31
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,990
As early as 1988 Time magazine wrote about what it saw as black yuppies, or“Buppies”.

32
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:51,190
Yet they still made up a minority of middle-class families in a country where three-quarters of people were black (today the share is more than four- fifths).

33
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:59,640
Academics differ over how to define the middle class, but agree that blacks have become a clear majority within it.

34
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:11,899
Ronelle Burger and her colleagues from Stellenbosch University reckon that their share doubled from 32% in 1993 to 64% in 2012.

35
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:28,690
A more recent paper by the economists Rocco Zizzamia, Simone Schotte and Murray Leibbrandt estimated that the share rose from 47% in 2008 to 64% in 2017.

36
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,550
Most black South Africans, however, are not middle-class.

37
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:46,260
According to the economists’ paper, which categorised people based on their income stability over many years, just 18% of black South Africans are secure enough to be deemed middle-class.

38
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:53,090
Almost half are“chronically poor”and nearly all the rest move in and out of want.

39
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,560
Many deemed middle-class support extended families and have large debts.

40
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,150
The key to middle-class stability, points out Mr Zizzamia, is a job.

41
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:13,030
And the most secure jobs are in the public sector, where blacks have climbed through the ranks more successfully than they have in business.

42
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:29,440
Some 66% of senior public-sector managers and 56% of those in state-owned firms are black, according to the Commission for Employment Equity, a watchdog, compared with 16% in the private sector.

43
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:37,760
“The black middle class is overwhelmingly rooted in public-sector employment,”argues Roger Southall, an academic.

44
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,390
He points out that the ANC has blurred the line between party and state.

45
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:55,620
It has passed affirmative- action laws (as well as policies of“black economic empowerment”that have enriched a few) and“deployed”party members in government positions.

46
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,580
Mr Mboweni’s proposals have been met with fierce opposition.

47
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,300
A legal challenge by trade unions was dismissed in December, but they may yet call for strikes.

48
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:14,590
This dispute is just the first in what may be a long fight over who bears the brunt of austerity.

49
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:22,580
It is a battle that could fray the ties between the ANC and the black middle class, which is not homogenous.

50
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:34,730
Honest civil servants are angry with the ruling party because its corruption has given anyone working in government a bad name, notes Ivor Chipkin, the author of“Shadow State”.

51
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:46,690
Nevertheless, because of its role in creating jobs, support for the ruling party has remained“pragmatic”and“sustained”, says Amuzweni Ngoma, a researcher.

52
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:57,800
Writing in 2016, Mr Southall speculated about what would happen to this conditional loyalty to the ANC if there were a“financial meltdown”.

53
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:05,069
He made a comparison with Zimbabwe, where the middle class at first did well under Robert Mugabe’s regime.

54
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:15,350
But as he ran the country into the ground and destroyed its economy, these Zimbabweans either emigrated or voted in greater numbers for the opposition.

55
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,130
There is another salutary story.

56
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:28,960
The National Party, which ran South Africa from 1948 to 1994, used its control of the state to increase the Afrikaner middle class.

57
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:41,610
But the madness of apartheid eventually undermined the economy and, in turn, weakened support for the party among its middle- class base—the sort of people who once lived in the Reeds.

58
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:50,060
If the ANC impoverishes the class it helped to build, it too will struggle to hold on to power.
