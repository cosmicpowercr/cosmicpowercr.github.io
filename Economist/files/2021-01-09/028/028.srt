00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:22,780
“MEN ARE adorable,”begins Yang Li in a sketch first aired last year.

2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,630
“But mysterious.

3
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,760
After all, they can look so average and yet be so full of confidence.”

4
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:39,430
It seemed a gentle dig by the newly crowned“punchline queen”of“Rock and Roast”, a television show starring amateur comics.

5
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,219
But as Ms Yang’s fans spread the gag, male netizens threw a tantrum.

6
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:52,160
Last month a group of them reported the 28-year-old to the broadcast regulator for“sexism”.

7
00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:01,640
An academic at Peking University called Ms Yang and her admirers“internet feminists, the most emotional and least tolerable people”.

8
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:08,380
Long the stars of Chinese joke-making, men are unhappy about being the butt of it.

9
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:19,100
Chizi, a popular male contestant on“Rock and Roast”with a penchant for boorish jokes about women, sniffed that Ms Yang was“not performing comedy”.

10
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:33,480
Guo Degang, a master of xiangsheng, a witty and often bawdy form of traditional comedy involving banter between twopeople, recently said he would not recruit women for his troupe (“out of respect”, he said).

11
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,290
Very few women perform xiangsheng.

12
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:42,819
Western-style stand-up comedy has taken off since it appeared in China a decade ago.

13
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,179
It is proving to be a more accessible art form for female comics.

14
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:56,940
With stand-up, says Evangeline Z, a 27-year-old comedian in Shanghai,“there are no barriers to joining as long as you can talk.”

15
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,970
Women bring new themes to the stage.

16
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:10,730
On the latest season of“Rock and Roast”, a vlogger quipped about coping with depression, twins joked about body-shaming and a car engineer about her career.

17
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:18,270
The show, which began in 2017, has been a boost for Chinese stand-up and female participation in it.

18
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,350
Evangeline Z says the form of comedy is“huge”in Shanghai.

19
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,600
And she reckons up to half of the city’s 50-odd weekly performances are by women.

20
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:38,980
But male and female comics alike warn spectators that what they are about to say could be offensive and they should not take offence.

21
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:53,700
Xiao Ju, a 22-year-old part-time comedian, also in Shanghai, says that showgoers expect to come in for“a bit of easy laughter”, so are ruffled when the ribbing reveals something about themselves.

22
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,610
Female comedians elicit stronger reactions from the audience than male ones, says Xiao Ju.

23
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,540
Many people are still shocked when women swear on stage.

24
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,549
A gag about a prostitute told by a male comic draws tuts if delivered by a woman.

25
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,070
“Sex is a perilous topic,”says Xiao Ju.

26
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,550
“So are shit, piss and farts.

27
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,790
If a man jokes about these, everyone laughs.

28
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,240
If a woman does, she is disgusting.”

29
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,379
For fear of offending, many stick to crowd-pleasing themes like families and jobs.

30
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,060
Ms Yang has used the backlash against her gag to create a new one.

31
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:40,730
It involves an exchange with a male colleague who approvingly notes her testing of men’s limits.

32
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,520
Her mock-incredulous riposte:“Do men have limits?”
