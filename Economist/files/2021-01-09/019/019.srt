00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:31,449
WITHIN DAYS Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, is expected to sign a law making abortion legal.

2
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,410
Argentine women will be able to terminate their pregnancies within the first 14 weeks for any reason.

3
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,050
The measure is a big deal.

4
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:54,210
With 45m people, Argentina is the fourth-most-populous country in Latin America, a predominantly Catholic region, and the native country of the current pope.

5
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:01,890
It is now the largest of the few Latin American countries that allow abortion on demand (see map).

6
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:10,190
Argentina’s new law will see the share of women in the region with such access rise from 3% to 10%.

7
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:25,770
Pro-abortion groups hail it as part of a marea verde (green wave), named for the verdant scarves worn by women’s-rights campaigners, not all of whom advocate greater access to abortion.

8
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:37,740
Argentina’s decision has inspired discussion in Peru, says Susana Chávez, an obstetrician and congressional candidate for the centrist Purple Party.

9
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:45,070
There is“an opening, and parties andpoliticians are starting to talk about it”, she says.

10
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:58,960
Mexico’s left-wing president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has tried to avoid the issue, seemed to grant the possibility of liberalisation after Argentina’s decision.

11
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,630
Women should decide whether the law should be changed, he said.

12
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:11,770
But Argentina’s decision will also invigorate abortion’s foes, many of whom are women.

13
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:20,780
“It sets up a battlefield,”says José Miguel Vivanco of Human Rights Watch (HRW), a pressure group.

14
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:30,560
Anti-abortion activists in Argentina, who have adopted sky blue as their colour, say the new law is unconstitutional.

15
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:44,600
As the health ministry rushes to deliver misoprostol, a medication that can terminate pregnancy, to the country’s provinces, abortion’s foes are preparing challenges in the courts.

16
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,440
By global standards, abortion laws in Latin America and the Caribbean are unusually restrictive.

17
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,770
Cuba, Guyana and Uruguay allow abortions on demand within the first trimester.

18
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,130
(In Britain they are elective until 24 weeks.

19
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,679
) Belize allows terminations on social or economic grounds.

20
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,009
Most other countries allow a woman to end her pregnancy in narrow circumstances.

21
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:27,800
Some in Central America, including El Salvador and Nicaragua, impose an absolute ban, with harsh penalties for women and doctors who breach it.

22
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,910
The region has been less conservative on other social issues.

23
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,470
Many countries that ban most abortions allow same-sex civil unions.

24
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,310
Bolivia, which has a restrictive abortion law, had its first gay union in December.

25
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:53,740
Before Argentina’s leap, other countries had taken small steps towards liberalisation.

26
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:09,260
In 2017 Chile passed a law allowing a woman to terminate a pregnancy if it endangers her life, or she has been raped, or if the fetus has a fatal impairment.

27
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:17,540
A number of Latin American countries, including Colombia since 2006, have similar provisions.

28
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:31,160
In 2019 the Mexican state of Oaxaca became the second federal entity, after Mexico City, to allow elective abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

29
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:38,490
Politicians and courts in several other countries are considering looser restrictions.

30
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:48,429
Peru’s Purple Party says it will promote“reproductive rights”if it wins the presidency in elections to be held in April.

31
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,560
The issue may come up this year in Chile when it drafts a new constitution.

32
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,329
The current one“protects the life of the unborn”(as does Guatemala’s).

33
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:11,560
In September Causa Justa, an NGO, filed a lawsuit that seeks to change Colombia’s penal code to decriminalise abortion.

34
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:19,810
Still, failures to liberalise, both through parliaments and the courts, are as numerous as successes.

35
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,460
Criticism of Argentina’s law has been widespread.

36
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,850
Paraguay’s Congress marked it with a minute’s silence.

37
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:39,010
Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, said that under his government“abortion would never be approved in our land”.

38
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,889
Such backlashes are common.

39
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:50,130
After Mexico City legalised abortion in 2007, 20 Mexican states tightened restrictions.

40
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:58,790
Reproductive resistance The Catholic church, which teaches that life begins at conception, remains powerful in Latin America.

41
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:07,810
In places where it has weakened, evangelicals have taken up the cause with equal zeal, if less institutional clout.

42
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,259
Under the Trump administration the United States has backed resisters.

43
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,660
It ended or reduced funding of organisations that provide abortions or advocate liberal laws.

44
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:29,690
Last year it reduced financing for the Organisation of American States for supporting easier access to abortion.

45
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:41,500
Although a large share of politicians are women, including more than half of MPs in Cuba and Bolivia, many do not press for greater access to abortion.

46
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:49,599
Some rights groups that are vocal about issues such as femicide do not campaign to make abortion legal.

47
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:54,039
Most Latin Americans are still conservative on the issue.

48
00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:12,559
A recent poll found that only 35% of Argentines and 16% of Peruvians thought women should be allowed to terminate early pregnancies without restrictions, compared with more than 60% in several western European countries.

49
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:23,369
In cases where a woman has been a victim of rape, support for abortion rises to 72% in Argentina and 49% in Peru.

50
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:26,740
Bans do not prevent abortion.

51
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:35,420
Worldwide, in any year, 39 women out of 1,000 aged 15-49 have abortions.

52
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,300
In Latin America the rate is slightly lower, at 32.

53
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:50,940
But in the United States, Canada and Europe, where rules are more permissive, the rate averages just 17.

54
00:07:50,940 --> 00:08:04,389
What bans do, point out campaigners for liberalisation, is make abortion unsafe and lead to harsh penalties, including prison sentences, for women and medical professionals.

55
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:14,630
In Venezuela maternal mortality rose by 66% between 2015 and 2016, according to its health ministry.

56
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:23,489
A rise in the number of abortions, which are thought to cause a fifth of maternal deaths in the country, contributed to the increase.

57
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:30,610
Women who miscarry or have stillborn children can be accused of having had an abortion.

58
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:45,620
In Colombia denunciations by hospital staff initiated 73% of abortion investigations between 1998 and 2019, according to the country’s attorney-general.

59
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,290
These breach patient confidentiality.

60
00:08:50,110 --> 00:09:00,360
In Nicaragua Silvia (not her real name) began bleeding profusely after taking misoprostol to end a pregnancy a few years ago.

61
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:13,000
She went to hospital, but after two nurses examined her and told her to wait for a doctor to perform an ultrasound she fled for fear of being handed over to the police.

62
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,609
Such cases are not uncommon.

63
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:20,590
Simply making abortion legal does not make it available.

64
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:33,470
In Argentina rural women and poor city-dwellers who were entitled to an abortion under the country’s old law could rarely get one, according to a recent report by HRW.

65
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:41,850
In Costa Rica the exceptions to the country’s ban were so vague that many doctors refused to perform abortions.

66
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:51,450
The president, Carlos Alvarado, published a 13-page clarification last year to provide“legal certainty”.

67
00:09:52,350 --> 00:10:00,580
Last August in Brazil a hospital refused a legal abortion to a ten-year-old girl who had been raped by her uncle.

68
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:12,579
She had to be smuggled through the back door of a hospital 1,400km (900 miles) away in another state, which performedthe procedure.

69
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,520
Anti-abortion protesters had gathered there after her name was leaked on social media.

70
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:28,750
Prosperous women in Latin America, which has the world’s highest level of income inequality, rarely have such troubles.

71
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:40,230
A popular saying holds that“las ricas abortan, las pobres mueren”—rich women abort, poor women die.

72
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:49,450
Those who wear green scarves hope that Argentina’s new law will at least lead to fewer women dying.
