00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,940
WIKIPEDIA IS CLEAR on the matter: Wikipedia is not a reliable source.

2
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,160
Yet on this particular question, few people seem to agree with the world’s most popular encyclopedia.

3
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:38,700
The site approaches its 20th birthday, on January 15th, as the 13th-most-visited place on the web, offering more than 55m articles written in 300 languages.

4
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:47,519
Worries about fake news, filter bubbles and market power have soured public opinion on the Utopian promises of the early internet.

5
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:54,319
But Wikipedia—written by amateurs, freely available to all—stands as the great exception.

6
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,940
It is the dream that worked.

7
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,260
Or at least, mostly worked.

8
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:06,089
Wikipedia’s crowdsourced model remains vulnerable to the occasional hoaxer or chancer.

9
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:16,810
In August it emerged that many articles on the Scots version of the site had been written by an American editor who, by his own admission, was not really a speaker of the dialect.

10
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,120
Nor is it free from honest mistakes.

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:32,770
That can cause problems: for better or worse, powerful platforms from social-media firms to the WorldHealth Organisation have come to treat it as a wellspring of truth online (see article).

12
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,590
All the same, the world is much better off for its existence.

13
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,140
Indeed, familiarity may have dulled the scale of its achievements.

14
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:49,060
As well as being roughly as accurate as old-style encyclopedias, Wikipedia is also incomparably broader.

15
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:57,080
Curious readers can learn about worthy subjects like Homer, general relativity or the Taiping Rebellion.

16
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:09,930
They can also read about Québécois slang, the nature of magic in the“Harry Potter”novels and the fortunes of Yeovil Town Football Club, which toils in obscurity in the fifth tier of the English league.

17
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:19,300
Denis Diderot, the 18th-century editor of the French Encyclopédie, hoped to“assemble all the knowledge scattered over the face of the Earth”.

18
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,250
Wikipedia would have delighted him.

19
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:27,360
The project owes much of its success to its unique structure.

20
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,340
Funded by donations, Wikipedia earns no profits.

21
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,640
It has no venture-capital backers demanding growth at all costs.

22
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:42,739
Without advertisers to satisfy, it can focus exclusively on the interests of its readers and contributors.

23
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,100
It is curated and run by people, not machines.

24
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:55,890
There is no recommendation algorithm humming away in the background, choosing what to show readers in order to keep them glued to the site for as long as possible.

25
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,170
Other tech titans should study its success.

26
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,870
Relying on algorithms is one reason they have achieved enormous scale with so few employees.

27
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,120
Yet the downsides have begun to haunt them.

28
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,770
As the social-media giants hire ever more people as moderators, and write ever longer sets of rules about what is allowed, Wikipedia offers a lesson in how to run a human-powered website.

29
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:32,429
It is also a welcome boost for Enlightenment values, which have suffered at the hands of populism and authoritarian capitalism.

30
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:42,940
If Wikipedia’s occasional scandals make people approach it with a little scepticism, all the better, for fair-minded scepticism is a healthy attitude in general.

31
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,060
Wikipedia sees itself as a work in progress.

32
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,889
If a fact is wrong, it invites users to persuade others so that it can be corrected.

33
00:03:52,580 --> 00:04:02,020
Its internal culture holds that knowledge comes from evidence, reason and good-faith debate, not pronouncements from the pulpit or the party.

34
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,520
Like any institution, Wikipedia has flaws.

35
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,580
It sometimes fails to live up to its own ideals.

36
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,469
The nature of crowdsourcing means its quality varies.

37
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,580
The mostpopular articles receive the most scrutiny, and tend to be the best.

38
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,990
That leaves a long tail of obscure entries of lower quality.

39
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,539
Articles can be overlong, or too technical.

40
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:33,440
Much of its magic comes from the distinctive culture that has built up among contributors—but cultures can be fragile.

41
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,150
Perhaps its biggest flaw is that, for all its breadth, it is still too narrow.

42
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,870
A small number do a disproportionate share of the work.

43
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:54,190
That colours both the encyclopedia’s choice of entries and the way it covers them.

44
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,470
Wikipedians have been trying to change that, but progress has been too slow.

45
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,630
A lot is at stake.

46
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,450
In rich, liberal countries, where information is widely available, Wikipedia is a convenience.

47
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,670
In poorer places, and illiberal ones, it can be quietly revolutionary.
