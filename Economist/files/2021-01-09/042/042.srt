1
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:28,120
IMAGINE THE dinner party from hell and it would look a lot like the one politicians from Forum for Democracy (FVD), a Dutch far-right party, held in November.

2
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:38,990
It began with a row over the backing music, with guests torn between classical music or Ava Max’s“Kings & Queens”, a trashy dance hit.

3
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:48,220
Over lobster and wine, allegations of anti-Semitism among the party’s youth ranks were dismissed by its leader, Thierry Baudet.

4
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:56,280
Guests were asked how many people they would let die for the sake of freedom (“three million”was Mr Baudet’s offer).

5
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,440
Later, the FVD’S leader suggested that covid-19 was the work of George Soros.

6
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:09,839
In the days that followed, as accounts of the dinner surfaced, politicians from the party lined up to quit.

7
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,890
It was a spectacular collapse after a remarkable rise.

8
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:25,419
Founded only in 2016, FVD was feted as the future of the far right in the EU, briefly topping opinion polls in 2019.

9
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,980
Its piano-playing, Hegel-quoting leader was breathlessly profiled in the press.

10
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,320
Now it goes into a general election in March hoping for a few seats at best.

11
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:48,660
A clown ceiling exists in EU politics, which has kept Eurosceptic parties such as FVD from gaining too much power.

12
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:55,540
Such parties tend to grow quickly before collapsing, often due to their own risible ineptitude.

13
00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:03,910
The pattern repeats itself across Europe: a rapid ascent, a noisy thud against the ceiling and a swift retreat.

14
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:10,290
In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) emerged in 2013.

15
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,030
By the 2017 election, AfD was the biggest opposition party in parliament.

16
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:24,100
Since then, it has been marred by far-right extremism and infighting, both metaphorical and physical.

17
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:33,230
(During one row, a senior AfD politician gave a colleague a“friendly bop to the sides”, which ruptured his spleen.

18
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:41,229
) Once known as the“professor party”because of the boffins in its ranks, it is now associated with thugs.

19
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:50,260
In Europe, those who are most willing to lead upstart movements are often the least suited for the long-term task.

20
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:57,220
Some parties have managed to punch a hole in the clown ceiling, but not one big enough to break through.

21
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,690
Traits that lend themselves to insurgency do not translate well into governance.

22
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,670
The Northern League, an Italian hard- right party, took power in 2018.

23
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:19,980
A year later, while riding high in the polls, Matteo Salvini, its leader, brought down his own coalition to try to trigger an election.

24
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:28,690
It backfired and Mr Salvini found himself back in opposition with his party’s polling dented.

25
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,900
Sometimes, the failings are ones of character.

26
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:47,460
In Austria, the far-right Freedom Party was in power before footage emerged of its leader lounging on a sofa offering state contracts to someone he thought was the niece of a Russian oligarch.

27
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,640
A jester in government can swiftly look out of place.

28
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:59,770
Fortunately for the EU, hostile parties outside it often seem just as clownish.

29
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,570
Britain mucked up leaving the EU so badly that no other country looks likely to copy it.

30
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,470
In 2016 EU officials feared Britain’s exit.

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,790
They worried that Britain could be a nimble, efficient state on its borders.

32
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,700
Instead it became a big flailing one.

33
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,519
Britain needed four years, three prime ministers and two elections to fully leave the bloc.

34
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:35,580
Rather than striding out as a proud independent state, it waddled out of the EU with its foot in a bucket.

35
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:43,200
In the eyes of some of its European peers, Brexit has turned Britain into a clown state.

36
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,920
Britain is at least a friendly clown.

37
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,280
The same cannot be said for Russia and Turkey, which actively try to undermine the EU.

38
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,860
But they pose a problembecause they are large and close to the EU, not because they are well led.

39
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,809
Recep Tayyip Erdogan keeps on overplaying his hand.

40
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:14,230
A failed plot to bus migrants to the EU’s border demonstrated the limits of Mr Erdogan’s powers, rather than their potency.

41
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,710
Likewise, Vladimir Putin is often credited with blood-curdling geopolitical cunning.

42
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:31,070
But the reality is not always so fearsome, if his government’s latest attempt to kill its leading critic, Alexei Navalny, is anything to go by.

43
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:42,530
A scheme to poison his underpants was unwittingly exposed by one of the would-be assassins in a jaw-dropping recorded phone call with Mr Navalny.

44
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:48,360
Mr Putin and Mr Erdogan are sometimes more slapstick than sinister.

45
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,650
Even the more intellectual critics of the EU cannot escape the circus.

46
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,850
Their points are often valid.

47
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:09,859
Few argue today that building a monetary union without a proper lender of last resort was a bright idea, or that the EU’s handling of the refugee crisis was a masterclass of policymaking.

48
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,709
Where the critics erred was in assuming that such problems would inevitably lead to the EU’s collapse.

49
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,290
This takes the pressure off the EU.

50
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,570
But avoiding destruction is a low bar to clear, if success is defined by mere survival.

51
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,600
When the circus gets serious Criticism by clowns can lead to complacency.

52
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:41,200
Because so many of the EU’s opponents implode or cock up, the dangerous assumption exists that they always will.

53
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:49,580
When the EU does go wrong, the fact that its loudest critics are jokers means the often-valid messages are ignored.

54
00:06:50,290 --> 00:07:02,090
EU politicos recall David Cameron’s attitude to the UK Independence Party, which he dismissed as a bunch of“fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists”.

55
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:08,590
Ten years later, Britain was leaving the EU and Mr Cameron was out of a job.

56
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,539
Being run over by a clown car is no joke.

57
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,760
Relying on the ineptitude of opponents is not viable in the long term, as Britain’s exit attests.

58
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:29,650
Within the EU, Hungary provides an example of what happens when a clever politician takes the reins of an insurgent party.

59
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:37,880
In the past decade Viktor Orban has made himself almost impregnable, outwitting attempts by the EU to frustrate him.

60
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,420
Even poorly led insurgent parties still gather up to a quarter of the vote.

61
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,130
This may simply be a natural limit of support.

62
00:07:47,629 --> 00:08:00,880
Euroscepticism is a minority pursuit in most countries, and voters are in general becoming more tolerant of matters like immigration whichonce gave outlandish parties a solid base of support.

63
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:12,100
Attracting loyal voters requires competent leadership, which has—mercifully, from the EU’s perspective—been lacking in far-right outfits.

64
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,770
The clown ceiling has held solid.

65
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,109
But, as Mr Orban shows, those who smash through it can be hard to stop.
