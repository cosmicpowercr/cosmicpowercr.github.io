1
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,210
IN ALL THE world there was nothing as beautiful as a goat.

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:47,010
As she sat among them on the steep wooded slopes of the Valle di Felice, watching them tussle and shimmy in the tall weeds, Agitu Gudeta rejoiced in their long shoulders and strong legs, their compactness and the grace of their horns, curving back like swords.

3
00:00:47,590 --> 00:01:01,730
When they came close, for they loved crowding round, she fondled their ears and kissed their noses, stroked their fine hair and basked in the sight of their faces gazing down on her against the clear Italian sky.

4
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:11,700
These were not just any goats, but Pezzata Mochena, the ancient piebald race of the high Alpine region near the Austrian border.

5
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,030
They came in all goat-colours, but mostly streaked and patched with black or warm red- brown.

6
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:30,250
In 2010, when she bought 15, they were almost extinct; within a decade she had 180, and knew the names and characters of every one of them.

7
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:49,890
So she would chide Cinnamon, as she gently cleaned her udder, forsitting in muck again, and rebuke Kay for trying to climb into her car, and as she led them all out to pasture she would shush them like a congregation of children, blithely twirling her stick in her slim black hands.

8
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,230
Yes, she was black.

9
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,579
The goats did not notice, as they also paid no attention to her tall African hat.

10
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,709
But people certainly did.

11
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:10,490
The Mochena region was a closed place, still inhabited by descendants of Bavarians who ate dumplings, lived in chalets and spoke a dialect of German.

12
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:18,089
They distrusted all strangers, including the regular pedlars who sold fabric out of their vans.

13
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:36,980
And they had never seen a black face except on Shrove Tuesday, when carnival was led by the betscho and betscha, one in a skirt, one with a tall goatskin hat and a false hump made of straw, both in blackface, who clowned to bring prosperity.

14
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:46,360
Now here among them was a real black woman, an Ethiopian refugee, living in the mountains alone with her goats.

15
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:54,360
Well, she thought as she worked away, herding and milking and scrubbing, she could bring in prosperity too.

16
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,630
Her parents had gone to California; she had come here.

17
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:07,730
She had fled from Ethiopia in 2010 with nothing, determined to leave nostalgia behind and reinvent herself.

18
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:21,600
Her work back there, menaced by trigger-happy police and a warrant for her arrest, had been to defend nomadic herders whose grazing lands were being grabbed and leased to corporations by the government.

19
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,000
Neo-colonialism, in a word.

20
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,000
But in Italy too land was being squandered, good green land, as people left.

21
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:42,330
So she did what her herding grandparents would have done: put her goats on communal pastures that had been abandoned, and let their munching and manuring gradually restore them.

22
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,130
The Mochena breed were not abundant milkers, but she soon had milk and yogurt to sell.

23
00:03:49,630 --> 00:04:04,060
Then came cheese, eventually 15 different kinds adapted to local tastes—of which her special treasures were the primo sale, the first fresh salted ones, which tasted completely different in a week.

24
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:13,250
Her dairy in Frassilongo, the nearest village, was in a building once intended as a primary school when there were still enough children in the valley.

25
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:26,110
There she stirred the big vats of curds just as joyfully as she led her goats up the valley, and taught local girls to make cheese as she had learned it on courses in France.

26
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,460
Nothing pleased her more than hearing people say her cheese was good.

27
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,200
It won prizes.

28
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:47,879
In Trento, the main town of the region, she ran a stall on market day and in 2020 opened a shop called La Capra Felice, the Happy Goat,which served Ethiopian coffee alongside all the dairy stuff.

29
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:55,880
Happiness was her watchword: happy goats, happy customers, a happy place filled with local activity.

30
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,320
She called it her philosophy of community.

31
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:09,850
It was a crazy life, up at 6am to milk, then to the dairy or the shop, then up to the pasture, milking again, dairy again, paperwork, bed.

32
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:17,220
It used all her strength, she adored it, and her sheer energy won the locals over.

33
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:27,870
Journalists from around the world came to see her in her jeans, cami-top and Ethiopian hat, a symbol of integration for all of Italy.

34
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,790
For the first eight years she could tell them, with her joyous smile, that there had never been any trouble.

35
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,250
Suspicion, yes, at first.

36
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,430
But actual trouble, no.

37
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,209
And she had been lucky.

38
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:56,710
After high school she had studied sociology in Rome and Trento on a scholarship, so she already spoke good Italian, and though she had returned to Ethiopia afterwards her Italian residency papers were still in order.

39
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,320
In Trento, she still had friends.

40
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:09,080
During last year’s lockdown friends old and new passed word that she had a lot of perishable stock to clear, and everything was sold.

41
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:25,300
Yet there had always been more difficult neighbours: bears and wolves, which she scared away with bangers, and a few thugs, fans of hard-right politicians, who rode motorbikes among the goats or set their dogs on them.

42
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:33,930
In 2018 a man came into the barn as she cleaned the milking machine, seized her by the shoulder and told her to go back home.

43
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:39,530
Another sliced the udder from one of her loveliest pure-white goats.

44
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,730
She had blamed wolves at first.

45
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:51,959
It felt safer now to move down from her secluded mountain shelter to Plankerhof, a hamlet near Frassilongo, to a flat beside the church.

46
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,530
The intruders said her goats had damaged their property.

47
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:03,010
They also objected to the African refugees and migrants she took on to help when she was busiest.

48
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,719
That was her latest project, to use a fine resource that was being wasted, just like the land.

49
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:15,910
She would find young men with permission to stay, but no work, and teach them to look after goats.

50
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,490
Naturally they could handle it; they were refugees.

51
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:28,780
Local jobless lads might want to join in too, and they could even form co-operatives—her teeming mind running ahead of itself, as usual.

52
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:38,779
She began by taking on one young man at a time, from Ghana or Mali, hoping to transform them into goat-lovers as fervent as herself.

53
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,070
From the start, as they climbed up to pasture, she would ask them:“Are you happy?”

54
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,950
They had to be, she felt.

55
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:56,959
But it was not so for Suleimanfrom Ghana, who just after Christmas argued with her about unpaid wages, and ended by killing her.

56
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:02,740
Evading the police, he fled up to the barn and tried to lose himself among the goats.

57
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,420
But they were hungry and agitated by the absence of their mistress, and did not welcome him.

58
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,710
Once he was taken away, the good neighbours of Frassilongo trudged through the snow to feed them.
