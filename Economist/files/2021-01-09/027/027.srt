1
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:29,970
THE NATIONAL-SECURITY law which China imposed on Hong Kong in June was meant, some of its backers once insisted, to rely more on its bark than its bite.

2
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:42,970
During its first months in force, only 35 people were arrested (just four were charged) under the bill, which criminalises acts such as inciting secession and colluding with a foreign power.

3
00:00:43,780 --> 00:01:00,910
The picture changed dramatically on January 6th when, in a pre-dawn raid, nearly 1,000 police officers fanned out across the city to search 72 premises and arrest 53 pro- democracy politicians and activists on grounds of subversion.

4
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:14,590
Those rounded up had stood for election in, or helped to run, an unofficial“primary”ballot to choose candidates for elections for the 70-seat Legislative Council (Legco) that had been scheduled for last September.

5
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,130
Among the arrested are Benny Tai, an academic and leading democracy activist.

6
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:35,770
Lester Shum and Jimmy Sham, organisers of some of the massprotests that roiled the territory in 2019-20, were also hauled in, along with prominent former legislators including Eddie Chu, James To and Alvin Yeung.

7
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:51,580
So too were civil-society figures, such as Lee Chi-yung, a campaigner for people with disabilities; Jeffrey Andrews, a social worker; and John Clancey, a human-rights lawyer who acted as treasurer for an outfit organising the primary.

8
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,930
Mr Clancey, an American, is the first foreigner to be apprehended under the law.

9
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,610
More than 600,000 Hong Kongers—around 8% of the population—voted in the primary.

10
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:12,460
At the time, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, described the process as“subversive”, though it was hard to see why.

11
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:25,150
Its point was to provide a unified slate that had a better chance of winning seats and even a majority in a chamber selected by a voting system that is heavily rigged in favour of the establishment.

12
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,790
As it turned out, the process was moot.

13
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,800
Mrs Lam postponed the elections by a year, conveniently attributing the move to the covid-19 pandemic.

14
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:43,189
In November China’s national parliament bypassed Hong Kong’s own courts to disqualify four pro-democracy legislators.

15
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,050
The 15 remaining opposition legislators resigned in solidarity.

16
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,430
Mainland officials and media thundered their approval of the arrests.

17
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:04,440
Explaining them, John Lee, Hong Kong’s secretary of security, accused the pro-democracy camp of“aiming to win 35 seats”, as if their goal should be to lose.

18
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,670
Mr Lee talks darkly of a plot to overthrow the government.

19
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:16,219
Prosecutors say the opposition had a“‘mutual destruction”plan to grind the government to a halt and then overthrow it.

20
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,190
A decisive victory would have given them power to vote down the budget.

21
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,360
In such an event, Mrs Lam would have to dissolve Legco.

22
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,980
If the new Legco were again to reject it, the chief executive would be obliged to step down.

23
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,499
The process is enshrined in the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution.

24
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,030
Yet that law now plays second fiddle to the central powers’ broader aims.

25
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:46,110
In any functioning democracy, winning a legislative majority is the point.

26
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:51,790
Hong Kong’s system, by contrast, is not only undemocratic, it is executive-led.

27
00:03:52,250 --> 00:04:02,360
Just as Britain’s colonial rulers never intended an opposition to gain legislative control, so Hong Kong’s overlord in Beijing is fierce in never countenancing it.

28
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:09,000
The arrangement sits at odds with China’s promises of autonomy and gradual democratisation in Hong Kong.

29
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,690
Some establishment figures in the territory (admittedly a minority) struggle with thecontradiction.

30
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:24,270
With a troubled logic, a senior government adviser says the democrats’ attempts to gain control of Legco were akin to Donald Trump’s supporters storming the Capitol.

31
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:27,070
Those arrested have yet to be charged.

32
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:36,030
They will be tried in Hong Kong’s still independent courts, which demand far higher evidentiary standards than Communist Party-controlled ones on the mainland.

33
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,650
In particular, courts will have to be persuaded that the threat of subversion was real and imminent.

34
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:49,850
It is possible, says a second government adviser, that many of those arrested will not be charged, and that even those charged may get off.

35
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:59,810
If that happens, calls for judicial“reform”made in mainland newspapers and by Hong Kongers keen to curry favour in Beijing will only redouble.

36
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,970
Their gripe is that too many people charged with anti-government activities get off.

37
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,510
The courts, in other words, could become the central government’s next target.

38
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,740
For now, though, the arrests mark an escalation in repressive tactics in Hong Kong.

39
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:31,990
The national-security law has already had a powerful deterrent effect: the mere threat of harsh treatment for anyone falling foul of the law— including life imprisonment or shipment to the mainland to face trial under Chinese jurisprudence—has helped to keep the streets clear of protesters.

40
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,309
But until now the purging of pro-democracy campaigners has tended to rely mainly on pre-existing laws.

41
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,380
Jimmy Lai, a combative media mogul, is the most notable exception.

42
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,530
He was charged in December with alleged collusion with foreign forces.

43
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,789
Yet kneecapping the opposition still leaves the chief executive beleaguered on all sides.

44
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:03,920
Many financial and other businesses tied to China applaud the crackdown with outward calm, while raking in money from buoyant financial markets.

45
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,839
But other international executives, who are concerned about Hong Kong as a regional centre, are starting to speak out.

46
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:21,170
This week the head of Sweden’s chamber of commerce, Kristian Odebjer, tweeted that Hong Kong’s crackdown was having“a significant negative impact on business”.

47
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:29,790
As Hong Kong’s image deteriorates, he added, it is getting harder“to defend why you should maintain costly operations here”.

48
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:43,850
Mrs Lam is deeply unpopular among those in Hong Kong who are critical of the government’s cosiness towards big business and of its poor record on everything from reducing inequality to road safety and recycling plastics.

49
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,150
Atthe same time, the second adviser points out, she is under pressure from the pro-establishment camp.

50
00:06:50,670 --> 00:07:01,450
Those with business on the mainland blame her for not responding to the pandemic with tighter lockdowns and more intensive testing so that restrictions on travel to the mainland can be eased.

51
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,360
Others eyeing Mrs Lam’s job when her term is over next year delight in attacking her.

52
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:15,020
Even central-government officials hold her in almost palpable disdain for drawing Hong Kong into a political mess.

53
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:27,450
In an unpublished survey of 250 students, academics at Chinese University and the University of Hong Kong found 87% had no confidence in their government.

54
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,650
The authors warned of a“powder keg”that could engulf the city again.

55
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,080
That may explain why officials are trying so hard to nip opposition in the bud.
