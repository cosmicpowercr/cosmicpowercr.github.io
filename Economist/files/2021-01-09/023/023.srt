1
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:32,320
WHEN KAZAKHSTAN’S president came to power two years ago, he made pronouncements that counted as radical in a country that had only just emerged from three decades under a single strongman.

2
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:42,830
Painting himself as a cautious reformer, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev promised“political competition”in the oil-rich Central Asian state.

3
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:56,450
That marked a change from his predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who won several elections with more than 90% of the vote and seldom faced any opposition from the rubber-stamp parliament.

4
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:14,030
Yet the general election to be held on January 10th —the first since Mr Nazarbayev resigned in 2019—seems even less democratic than the six previous contests since Kazakhstan became independent in 1991.

5
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,110
For the first time, no genuine opposition parties will appear on the ballot.

6
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,220
The ruling Nur Otan party will win in the usual crushing landslide.

7
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:41,999
Led by the 80-year-old Mr Nazarbayev, who continues to pull the political strings,Nur Otan has promised to improve public services and create jobs—tasks made all the more urgent since the pandemic induced an economic slump.

8
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,139
Four parties are in theory competing with Nur Otan.

9
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:50,730
All of them are staunch supporters of the government, however.

10
00:01:51,250 --> 00:02:04,190
None saw any reason to discuss allegations aired by Radio Liberty, an American-funded website and radio station, that the Nazarbayev family owns a global property empire worth some $800m.

11
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:17,570
One of the parties, Adal, is staffed by several colleagues of Mr Nazarbayev’s son-in-law, Timur Kulibayev, a wealthy investor and chairman of a business lobby group.

12
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:29,500
The Financial Times recently accused Mr Kulibayev of profiting from inflated procurement contracts during the construction of a gas pipeline—a claim he denies.

13
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:48,530
Voters can also opt for a party campaigning on rural issues or for one of two parties that loyally assisted the government in the outgoing parliament: Ak Zhol, which is led by a former functionary from Nur Otan, and the People’s Party of Kazakhstan.

14
00:02:49,370 --> 00:03:05,220
The National Social Democratic Party, a more credible opposition force, declined to run after receiving an unwelcome endorsement from Mukhtar Ablyazov, a Kazakh oligarch based in France whose own political movement is banned.

15
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:18,450
Determined to act as spoiler, Mr Ablyazov is now urging his supporters to back Ak Zhol, which will allow him to depict its voters as fans of his, whatever their true intentions.

16
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:28,600
Since Mr Tokayev promised greater pluralism, not a single new party has received the necessary government approvals to register.

17
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:36,329
“No one is erecting any obstacles for them,”Marat Beketayev, the justice minister, insisted last month.

18
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,930
Indeed, the government claims to have made it easier for new parties to register, by reducing the number of avowed supporters required.

19
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:52,340
The changes were part of a package of reforms billed as creating what the president called a“Listening State”.

20
00:03:53,369 --> 00:04:00,960
Yet the authorities have still found reason to refuse eight applications to form new parties over the past two years.

21
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:16,130
Most recently it turned down Nurzhan Altayev, an ex-MP expelled from the ruling party for questioning the government’s handling of the pandemic, on the ground that some of the people on the list of supporters he provided were dead.

22
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,000
“We see that Tokayev’s promised reforms were just idle talk,”complains ZhanbolatMamay.

23
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:30,690
His attempt to register a party last year failed when several delegates were arrested on their way to its founding conference.

24
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,270
International observers monitoring previous elections have complained of ballot-rigging.

25
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,070
This time there will be little scrutiny.

26
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:51,670
The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe is sending a delegation of just 35, even though Kazakhstan covers an area the size of western Europe.

27
00:04:52,430 --> 00:05:09,270
Draconian new restrictions have hobbled domestic monitors, leading Maria Lobacheva, who campaigns for greater popular engagement with politics, to label the election an“insiders’ get-together from which observers and voters are excluded”.

28
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:17,969
Some activists are calling for street protests like those that accompanied Mr Tokayev’s election as president in 2019.

29
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,810
But this year apathy may trump anger, if the scant turnout at recent demonstrations is any guide.

30
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,550
Others are urging citizens to express dissatisfaction by spoiling their ballots.

31
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,960
Yet others suggest a boycott.

32
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,620
It is all the political competition the country is likely to get.
