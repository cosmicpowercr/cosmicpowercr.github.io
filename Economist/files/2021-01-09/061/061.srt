1
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:26,719
THE TIES that bind the world’s two biggest economies are unravelling, in fits and starts.

2
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:31,539
The latest episode involved fits, starts and chaos.

3
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:47,620
On December 31st the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) announced that it would delist China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom, three telecoms giants, shares in which have been traded on Wall Street for years.

4
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:59,670
It did so, it said, to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order in November banning American investments in companies with links to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

5
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,270
This set off a fit among their American shareholders.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,710
As the trio’s share prices swung wildly, funds scrambled to sell their stakes before the delisting, which the NYSE said would occur by January 11th.

7
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:25,989
Speculation raged that CNOOC and PetroChina, state-run energy goliaths also listed in New York, could be next.

8
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,079
Then came the start.

9
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,000
Late on January 4th the NYSE declared it would not eject the firms after all.

10
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:42,910
Those same funds faced the prospect ofrepurchasing the shares, the price of which had popped up on news of the NYSE’s U-turn.

11
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,900
If that weren’t chaotic enough, two days later the NYSE changed its mind again.

12
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,470
It would, after all, boot out the three companies.

13
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,080
One thing is clear: Chinese companies listed in America face uncertain times.

14
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:13,200
In December Mr Trump signed a bipartisan law that would expel from exchanges in America those companies that do not allow American regulators to audit their accounts, which is the case for many Chinese ones.

15
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:23,989
On top of this law, Mr Trump’s executive order is likely to remain a problem; Joe Biden may hesitate to rescind it after he takes office on January 20th.

16
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,170
It affects more than 30 firms deemed too cosy with the PLA.

17
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:39,530
To comply, FTSE Russell, which maintains global equity indices, plans to cut at least 11 Chinese technology firms from its roster.

18
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,250
MSCI, a rival indexer, plans to boot ten Chinese firms from its benchmarks.

19
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,560
A rupture seems inevitable, then.

20
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,360
How much will it matter?

21
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:59,749
If it is limited to Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs), then not much.

22
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,810
Only about a dozen SOEs trade in New York—and only thinly.

23
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,470
Most have a more robust listing in Hong Kong or mainland China.

24
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:17,570
Paul Gillis of Peking University argues that“it makes no sense for these companies to have US listings and be subject to US regulations”.

25
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,830
That leaves two other potential casualties.

26
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:33,429
If private-sector firms are included the number of Chinese firms listed in America swells to over 200, many of them in hot industries like technology and finance.

27
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:39,140
Their combined market capitalisation exceeds $2,2trn.

28
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,620
Many may have links (however tenuous) with the PLA.

29
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:59,280
Losing access to America’s sophisticated investors and deep pools of capital would sting such innovators as Lufax, a mainland fintech giant, which pulled off a $2,4bn flotation in New York in late October.

30
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:10,750
That risk is why Alibaba, China’s e-commerce titan with a New York listing, hedged its bets in late 2019 by floating in Hong Kong as well.

31
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:12,409
Others may follow.

32
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,950
American investors would suffer, too.

33
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:25,390
Goldman Sachs, a bank, estimates that they hold 28% of the $2,2trn in Chinese-linked market value in America.

34
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:32,180
These stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 index of big American firms in recent years.

35
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:39,270
Those with no secondary listing in China, which have most to lose from expulsion, have done even better (see chart).

36
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,010
A hasty exodus by Chinese stars could force a fire sale.

37
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:55,030
With Mr Biden unlikely to go easy on China, the most investors can hope for is more coherence—and fewer fits and starts.
