00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,990
FOR A MAN in his own army’s cross-hairs, Nikol Pashinyan, the Armenian prime minister, seems unfazed.

2
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:29,059
As long as the Armenian people have the final say,“there will be no coup,”he told The Economist this week.

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,000
The only way out of the crisis consuming his country, he says, leads through the ballot box and early elections.

4
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,500
There are no tanks on the street in Yerevan.

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,340
But Mr Pashinyan is fighting for his political life.

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:53,990
On February 25th dozens of officers, including the country’s top soldier, Onik Gasparyan, demanded the prime minister’s resignation, accusing him of incompetence.

7
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:03,760
Mr Pashinyan called this an attempted coup, refused to step down and ordered Mr Gasparyan to do so instead.

8
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,830
(So far, he has not.

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:19,250
)  Tensions in Armenia have been brewing since November, when Mr Pashinyan signed an armistice with Azerbaijan, ending a war over Nagorno-Karabakh, a separatist ethnic-Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan.

10
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,740
More than 6,000 people died in the fighting.

11
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,050
Armenian defences were pummelled by Turkish drones and overrun by Azerbaijani ground forces.

12
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:37,640
Under the ceasefire agreement, Armenia gave up control of swathes of land which it had captured around Karabakh three decades earlier.

13
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,590
The enclave’s status remains unresolved.

14
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,030
Some 2,000 Russian troops have been deployed there to keep the peace.

15
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:54,470
To many Armenians, persuaded by the army and the government that the fighting was going their way, the surrender came as a shock and a betrayal.

16
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,760
Mr Pashinyan immediately came under fire.

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,740
The opposition blamed him for provoking the war and losing the peace.

18
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:04,659
Protesters stormed government buildings.

19
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:16,519
The army (and the Kremlin) bristled after Mr Pashinyan claimed that Russia’s Iskander missiles, which Armenia used at least once during the war, had turned out to be duds.

20
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,519
He backtracked after a phone call with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin.

21
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,030
The protests have attracted no more than a few thousand people.

22
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,500
But those who turn up seem to be spoiling for a fight.

23
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:39,800
“Pashinyan sold out my homeland and my people,”says Hrachya Abramyan, a veteran of both Karabakh wars, at a rally in front of the parliament.

24
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,890
“If he does not resign, we will grab him by the ears and throw him out like a dog.”

25
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:53,140
The opposition parties have not warmed to an offer of snap elections, presumably because they continue to trail in the polls.

26
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:56,460
Instead they propose a transitional government.

27
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:59,779
Some appear on the verge of endorsing an actual coup.

28
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,670
“I don’t like the idea,”says Davit Harutyunyan, a former minister.

29
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,510
“But if I feel that without taking the next step we risk losing the country and civil war, then definitely.”

30
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:27,630
Mr Pashinyan, a former journalist, came to power in 2018, when exasperation with decades of cronyism overflowed into mass protests, bringing down the government of Serzh Sargsyan, his predecessor.

31
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,370
Yet the tide that propelled Mr Pashinyan into power has ebbed.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,550
In elections two years ago, he won 70% of the vote.

33
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,110
Today only 39% of Armenians want him in charge.

34
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,910
He had already faced criticism for his handling of the economy and the covid-19 crisis.

35
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,739
He has made no new friends by shrugging off the blame for the lost war.

36
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,060
Many see a Russian hand in the army’s move against Mr Pashinyan.

37
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,670
Yet Russia may not want the Armenian leader gone, so much as tamed.

38
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:09,180
Mr Pashinyan was once eager to loosen Armenia from Russia’s grip and to improve relations with Western powers.

39
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,729
That is no longer possible.

40
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:25,800
Hobbling from a lost war, squeezed between two old enemies and frustrated by Western inaction, Armenia now depends on Russia’s security guarantees more than ever, no matter who is in charge.
