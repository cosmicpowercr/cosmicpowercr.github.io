1
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,030
SUPPLIERS HATE being made to wait for the cash they are owed almost as much as their customers hate parting with it.

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,290
What if high finance could help?

3
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:33,079
Specialist firms have indeed sprung up, offering to pay suppliers up front, then cashing in their customer’s cheque as the bill comes due weeks later.

4
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,900
By charging fees or a spread, the intermediary takes a cut for what is in effect a loan.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:49,360
But the woes this week of Greensill Capital, a provider of such supply-chain financing, highlight some of the risks lurking in overlooked bits of the financial system.

6
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:55,030
Greensill, founded just ten years ago, boasted it could help companies“unlock capital”.

7
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:05,130
Using techniques mastered by erstwhile slicers-and-dicers of subprime mortgages, it transformed the bills it took on into bond-like investments.

8
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:12,340
These could be sold to outside investors, such as hedge funds, desperate to find some yield in a low-interest world.

9
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:20,470
As long as the customers kept settling their invoices, a tidy profit could be made for investors—and the financiers behind all the alchemy.

10
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:29,719
By 2019 Greensill claimed to have arranged financing worth more than $140bn to over 10m customers.

11
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:34,180
Questions over whether the money would indeed keep flowing were never far away.

12
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,270
On March 1st Credit Suisse froze $10bn of funds stuffed with paper sourced by Greensill.

13
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:59,960
The Swiss investment bank warned of“considerable uncertainties”with respect to the valuation of the bonds linked to Greensill.

14
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,170
Within days Greensill itself was fighting off bankruptcy.

15
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:13,770
The firm is said to have sought relief from insolvent-trading laws in Australia, where part of its corporate set-up is based (its founder, Lex Greensill, is Australian).

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:22,530
By March 3rd it was reported by the Financial Times to be preparing to file for insolvency in Britain, where it conducts much of its business.

17
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:35,749
Apollo Global Management, an American private-equity giant, has been in talks to buy at least part of the franchise, at a fraction of the $7bn value Greensill, which had planned to list its shares, once hoped to achieve.

18
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,040
The swift downfall of a once-lauded financial firm will reverberate beyond the niche world of trade finance.

19
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:53,000
Greensill had worked up a profile as a scrappy innovator while also courting the establishment (David Cameron, a former British prime minister, was flaunted as an adviser).

20
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:03,330
Mr Greensill, who said the idea for the business came from seeing his farmer parents run into financial difficulty, and who is now in his 40s, became a youngish billionaire.

21
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:15,870
After a previous sticky patch in 2018 the firm had received $1,5bn in investment from SoftBank, a Japanese investment group fond of backing wildly ambitious undertakings.

22
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:21,030
Regulators are now wondering whether the model highlights risks they ought to have fretted about.

23
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:30,030
On March 2nd BaFin, Germany’s financial watchdog, took over control of a bank Greensill runs there, closing it to new business.

24
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:36,179
It has filed a criminal complaint against the bank’s management, accusing it of manipulating its balance-sheet.

25
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:42,810
(Greensill says it followed its auditors’ advice and was complying with the regulator’s previous requests.

26
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,160
) Another concern is what will happen to companies that used Greensill’s services to access capital.

27
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:58,270
One noteworthy borrower is Sanjeev Gupta, an Indian-born industrialist who has snapped up steelmaking assets in Britain and beyond.

28
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:09,949
Greensill was a big provider of finance to the GFG Alliance, a group of firms controlled by Mr Gupta’s family; Mr Gupta also once owned a stake in Greensill itself.

29
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:18,620
It was transactions linked to loans to Mr Gupta’s empire (which has not been accused of wrongdoing) that prompted BaFin to step in.

30
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:26,820
A spokesman for GFG said it had adequate funding, even as reports emerged of talks to secure loans from other sources.

31
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:31,530
The episode will also shine a light on the world of supply-chain financing.

32
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:39,460
Fans of the practice point out it keeps money flowing even as some cash-strapped businesses keep suppliers waiting for months to be paid.

33
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,459
But its accounting treatment is tricky.

34
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:50,470
There is evidence that some struggling businesses may seek to hide spiralling debt piles by using supply-chain-finance techniques.

35
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,060
Creative forms of financing work best when they rely on conservative accounting.
