00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:21,650
FROM DRIVE-IN cinemas to drive-through restaurants, Americans love doing things without getting out of their cars.

2
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,870
During the covid-19 pandemic they have taken to shopping in a similar fashion, too.

3
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:38,020
Kerbside pickup, where buyers’ vehicles pull up to retail outlets and dedicated staff help load online orders into the boot, helped supermarket chains notch up a banner year.

4
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:47,570
One in two American shoppers used kerbside or in-store collection last year, according to a survey by ShipStation, a maker of shipping software.

5
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,009
No big retailer in America can do without kerbside pickup.

6
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:58,510
Those that had it before the pandemic, including Target, Walmart and Kohl’s, have expanded their offerings.

7
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:06,250
On March 2nd Target reported record digital sales, which accounted for two-thirds of revenue growth last year.

8
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,840
These were powered by such“drive-up”purchases, which ballooned more than six-fold in the final quarter of 2020.

9
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,640
Shops that lacked kerbside operations hurriedly created them from scratch.

10
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:26,870
Some analyses have found that around 60% of American retailers now have the service, twice the share 12 months ago.

11
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:37,460
Even malls, which were struggling before the pandemic added to their woes as self-isolating consumers moved en masse to online purchases, are giving it a whirl.

12
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:57,310
Sarah Fossen, head of marketing at Rosedale Centre, a mall near Minneapolis with 150 retail tenants, recalls starting a service with parking space set aside for kerbside pickup at two entrances, only to discover that there was sufficient demand to add such space at all five main entrances.

13
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:04,020
Successful efforts get a number of things right, says Tom Enright of Gartner, a research firm.

14
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:09,800
Some of the imperatives are straightforward (install clear signs, offer sufficient parking space).

15
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:22,480
Others require retailers to make bigger changes; since they do not have to lug stuff to their car themselves, for example, kerbside shoppers often buy bulkier crates of bottled water or bigger bags of pet food.

16
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,510
A bit of technological nous comes in handy.

17
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:36,990
Some retailers are, for instance, using location tracking in their apps to know when exactly customers might arrive, so as to minimise waiting times, says Jean Chick of Deloitte, a consultancy.

18
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,819
Some waiting will be inevitable.

19
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:48,680
But, says Mike Robinson, who used to run digital operations at Macy’s, a big department-store chain, the period in line need not be wasted.

20
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:58,760
Lingering customers could be enticed with other offerings, from promotions to new products, in the same way that you might grab a chocolate bar while waiting at the cashier.

21
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,400
It is“the perfect time”to engage shoppers, Mr Robinson says.

22
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,280
Many shops still have to crack important aspects of this transition.

23
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:16,449
Most are not equipped for returns or exchanges and lack a seamless way for customers to add and pay for last-minute items.

24
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:22,760
Retailers could improve the experience with pop-up tables in the parking lot stocked with popular items.

25
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:32,340
As Mr Enright notes,“If kerbside is going to replace an in-store experience, it has to bring a lot of those in-store experiences out into the parking lot.”
