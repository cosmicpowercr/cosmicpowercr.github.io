A MODERN CORRESPONDENT wanting to communicate privately can use computerised encryption.

00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,020
Three hundred years ago, origami would have been a better bet.

3
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:38,010
Before gummed envelopes became common in the 1800s, letters were posted with no security wrapper.

4
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:52,559
Privacy-minded writers relied instead on cunning combinations of folds, tucks, slits and seals, a practice Jana Dambrogio at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has dubbed“letterlocking”.

5
00:00:54,709 --> 00:01:03,230
Some, like the“chapel fold”, in which the letter is turned into its own envelope and sealed, were the equivalent of simple padlocks.

6
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:05,089
Others were subtler.

7
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:13,810
The“dagger trap”relied on a concealed wax seal that would leave a telltale rip once a letter had been opened.

8
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,600
But information about the practice is scarce.

9
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:28,039
Most historical letters survive in their opened form, leaving aficionados like Ms Dambrogio with little to go on but crease-marks and tears.

10
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:37,660
The few that remain unopened present a different problem: how to read them without permanently damaging the letterlock.

11
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,819
Now, in research published in Nature Communications, Ms Dambrogio and her colleagues have come up with a solution.

12
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:58,740
The letters in question are part of the Brienne Collection, a trove of thousands of undelivered 17th-century letters bequeathed to posterity by Dutch postmasters.

13
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,049
The collection includes 577 unopened, letterlocked missives.

14
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:13,800
To get at their letters’ contents while preserving the integrity of the locks, the team turned to X-rays and computers.

15
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,420
The key lay in knowing that the inks used at the time often contained iron.

16
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:34,160
This meant that an X-ray microtomography scanner, of the kind usually reserved for distinguishing teeth or bone from soft tissue, could reliably distinguish the metallic letters from the paper background.

17
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:48,250
Once the scan had also revealed the topography of the sheet, with the location of folds and creases mapped, the resulting model could be virtually unfolded by a computer to reveal the hidden text.

18
00:02:49,260 --> 00:03:07,790
Though some imperfections remain—a hole left by a burrowing worm, for example, or the dry scratch of an ink-free nib—the legibility of the scans rivalled anything one would find in a research library, says Dr Starza Smith, a researcher at King’s College London.

19
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:21,150
And although no spectacular secrets have yet emerged from the Brienne Collection, the technique seems to hold plenty of promise for future research into a fascinating historical practice.
