1
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:21,080
AT FIRST GLANCE one might have thought the cardboard box was a visiting head of state.

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:29,730
On February 13th Lebanon’s first batch of covid-19 vaccines emerged from a jet at Beirut’s international airport.

3
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,390
A delegation of officials drove out to meet it; local media broadcast the event live.

4
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,180
Never mind that the shipment contained a meagre 28,500 jabs.

5
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:48,849
After a miserable year of pandemic, economic collapse and a catastrophic explosion in Beirut, the vaccines offered a dose of hope.

6
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:55,050
Scepticism, a pre-existing condition in a country notorious for corruption, prevailed too.

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,910
Many Lebanese expected the rich and powerful to jump the queue to get their shots.

8
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:13,080
They drew some comfort from the involvement of the World Bank, which in January allocated $34m to fund vaccine imports, enough to cover doses for more than 2m people (a third of the population).

9
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,560
Lebanon was the first country to strike such an agreement with the bank.

10
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,860
It came, however, with conditions.

11
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,110
The bank demanded transparency.

12
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,879
Lebanon would have to set up a system for distributing vaccines.

13
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:28,089
Everyone would have to wait their turn.

14
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:36,240
“There will be no wasta,”said Ferid Belhaj, the bank’s top official for the Middle East, using an Arabic word that connotes nepotism.

15
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,580
The health ministry published a plan that allocated the first doses for medical workers and over-75s.

16
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,120
Elie Ferzli is neither.

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,940
That did not stop the 71-year-old MP and 15 of his colleagues from getting a dose on February 23rd.

18
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:59,339
About half were under 75, and they took their jabs at the parliament building rather than a designated hospital.

19
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,660
The World Bank raged.

20
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:07,460
Saroj Kumar Jha, a regional director, said the bank could halt its funds.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,550
A few MPs apologised.

22
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,840
Others claimed they were front-line workers in need of protection.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:21,870
Mr Ferzli embarked on a series of televised diatribes, called Mr Jha a liar and urged his bosses to“send a replacement”.

24
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:28,580
He took a further jab at him by mispronouncing his first name as“Farouj”, Arabic for a roast chicken.

25
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,470
The World Bank faced a dilemma familiar to Lebanon’s donors.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,900
To do nothing would set a bad precedent, in Lebanon and other countries with similar agreements.

27
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:42,429
But to halt funding would delay an already sluggish vaccine roll-out.

28
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:48,990
So far it has demanded only that the health ministry publish weekly data on vaccine distribution.

29
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,210
Most of Lebanon’s friends have tired of such scandals.

30
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,270
The country desperately needs help.

31
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,569
Its currency has lost 85% of its value since October 2019.

32
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:07,920
Hyperinflation has pushed more than half the population into poverty, with food prices up fourfold last year.

33
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,420
Daily blackouts are growing longer as power plants run short of fuel.

34
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:21,640
Despite a restrictive lockdown imposed in mid-January, Lebanon still has some of the world’s highest rates of new covid-19 infections and deaths.

35
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,310
Almost no one is queuing up to help.

36
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,910
The Gulf states have closed their purses, judging Lebanon too friendly with Iran, their arch-rival.

37
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:33,940
Western donors are tired of funding corruption and dysfunction.

38
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:44,750
A pot of $11bn in aid pledged at a donors’ conference in 2018 remains undisbursed because the Lebanese government failed to approve minimal reforms.

39
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,610
Talks with the IMF last year went nowhere.

40
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,360
The World Bank has been among Lebanon’s few remaining friends.

41
00:03:51,670 --> 00:04:01,220
In January it pledged a $204m loan to provide cash transfers to 147,000 poor Lebanese families for the next year.

42
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,440
Even there, though, Lebanon’s leaders found a way to twist the scheme to their advantage.

43
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:14,150
The money will be transferred to Lebanon in dollars but distributed to recipients in local currency at a below-market rate.

44
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,760
The Lebanese central bank, in other words, spotted an arbitrage opportunity in humanitarian aid.

45
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:28,300
Last month gunmen assassinated Lokman Slim, a prominent critic of Hizbullah, the Shia militant group-cum-political party.

46
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,790
(The murder, like most such killings in Lebanon, has not been solved and probably never will be.

47
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:42,510
) On March 2nd the pound hit 10,000 to the dollar, its weakest rate ever, which led to angry protests across the country.

48
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:50,380
Gone was the hopeful atmosphere of October 2019, when hundreds of thousands of people turned out for anti-government rallies.

49
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,140
The mood has turned dark.

50
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,020
Lebanon’s avaricious leaders may need protection against more than covid-19 in the months to come.
