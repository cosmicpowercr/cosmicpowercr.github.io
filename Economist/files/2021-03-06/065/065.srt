00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:21,630
PEOPLE HAVE to eat, so food firms the world over give reassuringly consistent profits, even in lean times.

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,630
Mexico is no different.

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:30,509
The country’s 126m people buy $55bn-worth of packaged food annually.

4
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:36,289
Sales of such fare have been growing quickly, notes Euromonitor, a research firm.

5
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:44,430
Between 2015 and 2020 they expanded by 6,9% a year, compared with 4% in America.

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,470
This trend should have lifted the likes of Bimbo, the world’s largest baker, and Gruma, its biggest maker of tortillas.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,330
Instead, like many Mexican businesses in recent years of sluggish economic growth, they have fallen out of favour with investors.

8
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:08,050
Stable profits notwithstanding, their market capitalisations are well below their peaks in the mid-2010s.

9
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:14,820
To whet the stockmarket’s appetite for their shares, both firms are doubling down on foreign markets.

10
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,580
America’s packaged-food market alone is nearly ten times the size of Mexico’s.

11
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,210
A loaf of Bimbo bread that costs $1,76 in Mexico sells for $2,77 north of the border.

12
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,280
These investments may at last be paying off, partly thanks to the pandemicinspired rush to comfort food.

13
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:55,740
In 2020 Bimbo’s sales in America and Canada rose by 22%; operating profits in the region shot up by 84%.

14
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,850
IRI, a data firm, puts it among the fastest-growing big consumer-goods companies in the United States.

15
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,170
Revenues north of the Rio Grande helped push Bimbo’s total sales to a record $16bn.

16
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,840
Operating profit hit $1,2bn.

17
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:22,840
Gruma attributed its own strong results last year to a growing fondness for tortillas among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Americans alike.

18
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:25,439
Further expansion will not be a cakewalk.

19
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,620
Bimbo’s bread and butter is simple fare that legions of poor Mexicans can afford.

20
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:39,730
To succeed in richer places like America the company will have to cater to more upper-crust consumers with varied tastes.

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,540
It is now experimenting with niche and premium products.

22
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,950
Last year the Bimbo-owned New York Bakery launched gluten-free breads.

23
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,110
Gruma has introduced naan and pita breads in some markets.

24
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,969
Lala, a dairy company that is Mexico’s third-biggest food firm, has got into organic milks.

25
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,860
Some of those innovations may come in handy at home, too.

26
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:15,279
As the share of Mexican who are obese has hit one-third, up from one-fifth in 1996, Mexico’s government has developed a growing distaste for unhealthy food.

27
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:23,700
In October it introduced a law forcing firms to label foods high in calories, sugars, salt or bad fats.

28
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,600
Both bread and tortillas qualify.
