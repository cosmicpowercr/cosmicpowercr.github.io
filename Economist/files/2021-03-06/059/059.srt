1
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:16,569
GERMANS ARE used to being top of the class.

2
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:17,739
Early in the pandemic, when Germany controlled its outbreak better than most of the West, they felt they were.

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:33,280
In vaccinating citizens against covid-19, by contrast, the country has been a laggard.

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:46,910
One in 20 has received a shot, compared with nearly a third of Britons, a sixth of Americans and, as Die Welt, a daily, recently grumbled, even a tenth of Moroccans.

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,290
German bosses are losing patience.

6
00:00:49,770 --> 00:01:00,460
Many workers at the industrial firms that dominate corporate Germany are vulnerable to covid-19 because factory or construction jobs cannot be done from home.

7
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:12,910
Nearly all companies in the DAX 30 blue-chip stockmarket index, as well as countless CEOs of smaller firms, are therefore preparing to launch their own immunisation drives.

8
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:25,999
They include BASF and Bayer (in chemicals), BMW and Volkswagen (carmaking), Deutsche Wohnen and Vonovia (property development) and RWE (energy).

9
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:35,110
The vaccines will come from the government, which has the doses but apparently not the capacity to get them quickly into arms.

10
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,570
Firms are buying ultra-cold freezers for shots that need such storage.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,150
The jabs will be administered by company doctors.

12
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:55,810
Germany has between 15,000 and 20,000 of them (not counting nurses), many more than other European Union countries, America or Britain.

13
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:04,470
About one-third of them are employed directly by firms and the rest run practices that serve employers in their area.

14
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:20,750
Anette Wahl-Wachendorf of VDBW, an association of company doctors, hopes that from April such medics will be able to dispense jabs alongside family physicians and 400-odd public vaccination centres.

15
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:26,770
They may reach perhaps 45m employees and their relatives, she reckons.

16
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,900
That is more than half of all Germans.

17
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,819
“As soon as we get the vaccine, we will get started,”promises Rolf Buch, boss of Vonovia.

18
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,450
His firm has already set up centres that will, starting this month, test employees who wish to return to the office for the virus.

19
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:56,080
These venues will be used to vaccinate its 10,000 employees and adult members of their immediate families, in keeping with official guidelines on who gets priority.

20
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:07,490
German labour law allows companies to give bonuses to workers who get vaccinated for any illness (though not at this time to make vaccination mandatory).

21
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:19,930
Such carrots are common in America, where Aldi and Lidl, two big German supermarkets, are offering workers payments of up to $200 to roll up their sleeves.

22
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:30,490
Neither grocer, nor any other big German firm, is currently planning to use such incentives at home, for fear of the controversy this might cause (see article).

23
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,710
Still, Mr Buch expects the vast majority of his staff to accept the offer of free shots.

24
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,360
Those who decline may be barred from office parties and other group activities.

25
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:51,890
Once Mr Buch is done with Vonovia employees and their families, he is willing to turn the company’s centres over to the general vaccination effort.

26
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:55,570
Other bosses are starting with the broader population.

27
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:12,499
In early December, before the first vaccines were approved for use in the EU, business folk in Bremen, a city in north-west Germany, launched a campaign to convert an exhibition centre next to the central railway station into a giant vaccination site.

28
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,730
Kurt Zech, a hotel-and-construction tycoon, contributed furloughed staff.

29
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,610
Mercedes, a carmaker, threw in tables and chairs.

30
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,890
Another company donated laptops.

31
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:31,860
A software firm adapted its programs for use in a call centre that helps residents to schedule appointments.

32
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:45,760
Thanks to the pushiness of Bremer businesspeople, up to 16,000 of their fellow burghers a day will get jabbed from mid-March, more than ten times what the local government had planned.

33
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:55,250
Their goal is to have 70% of the city’s adults inoculated by the end of July, months ahead of the government’s schedule.
