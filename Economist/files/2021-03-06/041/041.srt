00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:32,869
FOR MUCH of France’s Fifth Republic, the modern state established by Charles de Gaulle in 1958, criminal cases against elected politicians have often failed either to reach court or to end in a conviction, let alone a prison sentence.

2
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:39,310
On March 1st a Paris court took a step closer to ending an era of impunity.

3
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:50,000
It found Nicolas Sarkozy, a centre-right president from 2007 to 2012, guilty of corruption and influence-peddling.

4
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:54,559
He was sentenced to three years in prison, two of them suspended.

5
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,240
The decision has sent a shockwave through the French political class.

6
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,590
This is the first time an ex-president has been handed an irreducible prison sentence.

7
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:19,700
In 2011 Jacques Chirac, another centre-right former president, was handed a two-year suspended sentence for the misuse of public funds, dating to his time as mayor of Paris in the 1990s.

8
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,009
Mr Sarkozy has denied all the allegations, and has appealed.

9
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,249
The case against him dates back to 2013.

10
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:42,590
Investigators tapped his mobile phone while looking into allegations that Muammar Qaddafi, the former Libyan leader, had helped finance the French candidate’s campaign in 2007.

11
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,820
They stumbled upon conversations between Mr Sarkozy and Thierry Herzog, then his lawyer.

12
00:01:50,570 --> 00:02:00,999
These exchanges, which the pair thought were protected by lawyer-client privilege, concerned separate illegal party-financing allegations then circulating.

13
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,430
The case against Mr Sarkozy in that affair had been dropped.

14
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:10,290
But, prosecutors said, he wanted information linked to other inquiries.

15
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,810
During these conversations, ruled the court this week, a“corruption pact”emerged.

16
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:27,020
In return for information, Mr Sarkozy offered to help secure for Gilbert Azibert, an appeals-court magistrate, a plum job in Monaco.

17
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,550
(Mr Azibert never got the job.

18
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:37,439
) The court also gave Mr Herzog and Mr Azibert prison sentences of three years each, two of them suspended.

19
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,770
Both deny the accusations.

20
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:53,429
Mr Sarkozy, the judge said, who was“the guarantor of the independence of the judiciary, used his status as former president to reward a magistrate for having served his personal interest.”

21
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,600
Mr Sarkozy is unlikely to end up behind bars.

22
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,080
The court said he could wear an electronic tag instead.

23
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,930
He has in any case appealed, a process that could take many months, if not years.

24
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,910
Christian Jacob, head of his Republicans party, called the sentencing“absolutely disproportionate”.

25
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:27,180
Mr Sarkozy called it a“profound injustice”, and stressed that no money changed hands: even the judge said the ruling was based on a“faisceau d’indices”(a body of indications), not proof.

26
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,370
Friends say that magistrates were out to bring the ex-president down.

27
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:39,700
On March 17th Mr Sarkozy is due in court to face separate charges of exceeding campaign-finance caps.

28
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,270
He denies these accusations too.

29
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,620
In recent years, courts have convicted a string of French politicians.

30
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,269
This has begun to erode the sense that they are untouchable.

31
00:03:51,740 --> 00:04:03,170
Last year a court sentenced François Fillon, Mr Sarkozy’s former prime minister and a presidential candidate, to five years in prison, three of them suspended, for embezzlement.

32
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,079
He is awaiting his appeal.

33
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:22,339
Others include Jérôme Cahuzac, a Socialist ex-budget minister, Claude Guéant, Mr Sarkozy’s former chief of staff, and Patrick Balkany, an ex-deputy from Mr Sarkozy’s party and former mayor of Levallois-Perret, a Paris suburb.

34
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:33,940
In one of those twists at which the French excel, the once-hyperkinetic Mr Sarkozy has become more popular since he left office than when he was president.

35
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:42,879
Despite the judicial tangles, time and defeat at the ballot box in 2012 appear to have softened opinion towards Mr Sarkozy.

36
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:50,879
A recent poll, taken before the verdict, found him to be France’s sixth-most-popular politician.

37
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:59,430
He continues informally to oversee matters relating to the Republicans, ahead of the presidential election in 2022.

38
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:06,290
Some of those close to him suggest that, before this week, he had not given up hopes of running again.

39
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:19,980
This verdict surely puts paid to those ambitions and could open up the centre-right field, perhaps even to Michel Barnier, a former French foreign minister who ran the EU’s Brexit negotiations.

40
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,249
It may serve a broader purpose too.

41
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:37,430
The second conviction of an ex-president stands as a powerful sign that French politicians are held to the same standards as ordinary citizens—even those at the very top.
