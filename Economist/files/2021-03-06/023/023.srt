1
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:24,580
EACH DAY this week some 100,000 Chileans aged 60 to 64 turned up to get their inoculation against covid-19.

2
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:37,530
Having vaccinated nearly 20% of its adults, the sixth-best performance in the world, Chile is on track to meet its target of covering 80% of its 19m people by June 30th.

3
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:45,690
After starting with health workers, the jabs are being applied in strict descending order of age, a different year each day, and to teachers, too.

4
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,840
This swift and orderly programme contrasts with the rest of Latin America.

5
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:58,870
In vaccination as in other matters, the region displays its divisions, inequalities and problems of governance.

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,270
In this case, sadly, they will cost lives.

7
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,900
Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and several smaller countries have barely started jabbing.

8
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:15,730
Mexico, with 2% of its people vaccinated on March 1st, is below the world average of 3,5%.

9
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:27,530
In Brazil (4%) vaccination trails behind the new P,1 variant of the virus, which spreads faster than the original and seems to disregard prior natural immunity.

10
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:35,610
This week the health secretaries of Brazil’s 27 state governments declared that the country is suffering“the worst moment”of the pandemic.

11
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:45,869
The slow roll-out is largely because of the worldwide shortage of vaccines, especially from Western drug firms whose supplies have gone mainly to their home markets.

12
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:53,450
Argentina, Brazil and Mexico plan to make vaccines but have found it hard to source the active ingredients and vials.

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,080
Part of the problem is government fumbling.

14
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:09,820
Whereas the African Union made bulk pre-purchases, Latin America’s lack of regional co-ordination meant that countries raced against each other, points out Ernesto Ortiz of the Global Health Institute at Duke University.

15
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:24,179
In that race, Chile did two things right: in mid-2020 it agreed with several pharma companies to host vaccine trials to encourage early delivery; and its immunisation programme has an up-to-date digital database.

16
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:28,590
Many other governments have struggled with complex procurement negotiations.

17
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,610
The result is“patchiness”, according to Clare Wenham, a health expert at the London School of Economics.

18
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:43,740
Different vaccines, different priority groups and different distribution plans could complicate opening up the region’s economies, she thinks.

19
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,770
This patchiness owes much to political manipulation.

20
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:59,059
Vaccine distribution in Brazil has been particularly haphazard, because the federal government of Jair Bolsonaro, a populist who denies the seriousness of the virus, has absented itself from the job.

21
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:08,430
In Mexico, another federal country, the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador seized control of the vaccination programme from the states.

22
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:17,930
With an important election due in June, it decided that 333“highly marginalised”municipalities should get the vaccine first.

23
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,860
Many are rural and less hit by the pandemic than the cities.

24
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,640
Teachers have been jabbed before nurses, who are at higher risk.

25
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,509
This is queue-jumping on behalf of a political clientele.

26
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:33,930
Elsewhere it is the powerful who have jumped queues.

27
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:53,280
In Peru the health and foreign ministers resigned last month after it emerged that they were among 487 insiders who secretly benefited from sample doses provided by Sinopharm, a Chinese company, as a sweetener; another was Martín Vizcarra, who was ousted as president in November.

28
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,170
Health ministers in Argentina and Ecuador left after similar scandals.

29
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,080
These affairs have done no good for the credibility of democracy in their countries.

30
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,560
They also“play against trust in vaccination programmes”, says Dr Ortiz.

31
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,110
Polls suggest vaccine hesitancy has risen in Peru since last August.

32
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:22,440
Those vaccines currently available in the region come mainly from China and Russia, which have been quicker to deliver than their Western rivals.

33
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:27,540
China trades a lot with and invests a lot in several Latin American countries.

34
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,350
Vaccine diplomacy may give it soft power for the first time.

35
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,630
As for Russia, it had almost disappeared from Latin America since the end of the cold war.

36
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,530
Now it is back, and in a benign guise.

37
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,350
Vaccination is a marathon, not a sprint.

38
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:59,140
By February 27th Latin American countries had ordered 550m doses of Western vaccines, compared with 213m from China and 72m from Russia, according to Duke University.

39
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,270
Later this year, the Western doses should arrive in force.

40
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:12,700
Eventually, both the scandals and the source of the early vaccines may be forgotten if the region acquires immunity and new variants are kept at bay.

41
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:19,750
But it is more likely that the botched vaccination effort will have lasting political and diplomatic consequences.
