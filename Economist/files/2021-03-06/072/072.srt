00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:24,290
“THE WRITER of this piece deserves a big raise,”says Bret“The Hitman”Hart, a professional wrestler from the 1990s.

2
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,860
“He is the best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be,”he adds, echoing his old catchphrase.

3
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,110
Your correspondent paid Mr Hart $150 to sing his praises.

4
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:46,780
Mr Hart is one of over 10,000 celebrities on Cameo, an online service where anyone can commission famous people to film short messages.

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,729
Its popularity has surged as celebrities seek new sources of income and confined consumers look for ways to spend money.

6
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:03,320
Last year they paid some $100m for 1,3m videos, more than in the previous three years combined.

7
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:17,760
Talent on the site ranges from Jack Nicklaus, a golfer ($1,000 per clip), and Vicente Fox, a former president of Mexico ($300), to Barkley the Dog, a dog ($5).

8
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,099
Cameo, like Uber, is a two-sided market.

9
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:29,359
But most Uber users don’t care what car shows up, as long as it is clean, safe and gets them to their destination.

10
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:34,360
On Cameo, the emotional connection between a fan and a star matters.

11
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:47,020
“The price that a market will bear depends on the value being created for a potential customer,”says Jill Avery, a professor at Harvard Business School who has studied how online influencers price themselves.

12
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,390
But“value”is hard to measure when it comes down to emotion.

13
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,790
How do celebrities figure out their fees?

14
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,610
One way is through a simple opportunity-cost calculation.

15
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:06,400
Steven Galanis, Cameo’s boss, recalls speaking to a basketball player on an annual $25m contract.

16
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,560
For a 40-hour work-week with a fortnight of holiday, that is $208 per minute.

17
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:19,800
“If he charged $100 and did two or three a minute, he could make more money on Cameo,”says Mr Galanis.

18
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,449
Most celebrities are freelance, though.

19
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,860
They can try one of two strategies, says Ms Avery.

20
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:33,060
One is“price skimming”—starting high and then lowering the price as demand ebbs.

21
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:38,239
The second is“price penetration”, pricing low to maximise volume.

22
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,630
Celebrities often use both, depending on how much time they have.

23
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,750
Another method is to test the market.

24
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,550
This is surprisingly underused.

25
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:58,590
Though celebrities can change their prices as often as they like, only about 30% have done so at least once, and less than 10% have done so more than five times.

26
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:03,060
Less rational reasons are at play, too.

27
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:12,869
Snoop Dogg, a rapper famous for smoking copious amounts of weed, insisted on charging $420, a number associated with pot culture.

28
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:17,780
He could not keep up with demand and eventually raised his fee to $1,000.

29
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:24,030
Others charge a premium over perceived rivals or, led by ego, overprice themselves.

30
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,660
But reality eventually intervenes.

31
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:36,039
Mr Galanis remembers a TV personality who started at $60 and found that demand was inelastic all the way up to $99.

32
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,180
But when she raised her price to $125, demand dropped by half.

33
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,760
Value, like fame, is eventually decided by the fans.
