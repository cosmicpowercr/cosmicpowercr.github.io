00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,240
BEN HOUCHEN, the Tees Valley Mayor, is a persuasive man.

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:29,180
For more than a year he lobbied the chancellor of the exchequer to create a low-tax“freeport”in his bailiwick and move lots of civil servants there.

3
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,750
On the eve of Rishi Sunak’s budget speech he ratcheted up the rhetoric.

4
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:44,460
“The question is,”he wrote in the Northern Echo, a local newspaper,“does Rishi have the strength to stand up to the Whitehall mandarins that have held our region back for so long?”

5
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,219
The answer is yes.

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:57,200
On March 3rd Mr Sunak announced that many civil servants from business-oriented departments will move to a new campus in Darlington, west of Teesside.

7
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,780
Mr Houchen will get his freeport—a zone where normal customs rules and tariffs are suspended.

8
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:10,040
The mayor (a Conservative like the chancellor, who faces re-election in May) got everything he asked for.

9
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:13,670
But what is good for Mr Houchen is less good for Britain.

10
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,620
Moving civil servants to an area tends to boost its economy.

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:33,500
Giulia Faggio, an economist at City, University of London, estimates that a dispersal programme under the last Labour government created 11 private-sector jobs for every ten public-sector workers who arrived in an area.

12
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,970
But the effect is localised.

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:46,979
Private-sector employment swells in a small ring around the relocated civil servants and diminishes slightly a few miles away, as local businesses rush for the honeypot.

14
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:56,660
Darlington, which is already better-off than nearby towns and cities such as Hartlepool, Middlesbrough and Redcar, seems an odd place to favour.

15
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:08,820
In 2018 its gross value-added per head (a measure of output) was 92% of the British average, compared with 72% for the north-east region as a whole.

16
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,440
“It’s thriving already,”says Chris Hunter, the chief operating officer of Darlington Building Society.

17
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,490
When not closed by covid, town-centre shops sell Farrow & Ball paint and expensive bicycles.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,240
Tess Wheeler, who used to work in the local steelworks, guesses that a middle-class Londoner posted to the town will find it“quaint”.

19
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:44,110
It may owe its good fortune in part to its status as a Tory marginal; out of the 56 constituencies that will benefit from the first tranche of money from a“towns fund”, 47 are held by the Conservatives.

20
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,590
The civil servants may not want to move.

21
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:56,210
In 2003 the Meteorological Office managed to relocate 82% of its staff from Bracknell in the Thames Valley to Exeter.

22
00:02:56,679 --> 00:03:05,530
But a few years later only 10% of the Office for National Statistics’ London-based staff agreed to follow their employer to Newport in Wales.

23
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:14,090
The difference was probably that the ONS’s economists had plenty of other buyers for their skills, whereas the weather forecasters did not.

24
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:19,010
Ominously for Darlington, Treasury staff look more like the first group.

25
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,360
It is especially hard to winkle senior civil servants out of London.

26
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,850
Two-thirds of them are based there, compared with only a fifth of the civil service overall.

27
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:42,130
Philip Rycroft, who was permanent secretary of the Department for Exiting the EU until 2019, says they are glued to London because the politicians are there, and expect to be able to summon them quickly.

28
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,649
Mr Sunak might occasionally work in Darlington—his constituency is nearby.

29
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,159
But if the next chancellor is from Cornwall, the new campus will feel like a backwater.

30
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:59,750
The Teesside freeport should fare better, although not for the advertised reasons.

31
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:10,179
Imports to freeports are tariff-free, so components can be brought in and assembled into something else; tariffs are then paid when the finished goods are brought into the country.

32
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:16,340
That is a big advantage in high-tariff countries, but in Britain tariffs are generally low.

33
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:25,790
Julia Magntorn Garrett and Peter Holmes, economists at the University of Sussex, have looked for tariff structures that might draw a company to a British freeport.

34
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,770
They find only one big opportunity: dog food.

35
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:35,590
Yet Mr Sunak has thrown many bones to the eight freeports that will be created in England.

36
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,279
They will be given breaks on business rates, property taxes and national insurance contributions.

37
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,740
That should be enough to persuade some businesses to move there—if only from other parts of Britain.

38
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,280
“We’ve got investors lined up,”promises Mr Houchen.

39
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,180
It is, after all, not his job to worry about the country beyond the Tees Valley.
