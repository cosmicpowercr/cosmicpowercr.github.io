1
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:30,010
FOR MANY members of China’s 3m-strong domestic-security forces, these must be worrying times.

2
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:36,910
On February 27th the Communist Party declared the start of a long-expected purge of their ranks.

3
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:49,019
It will involve, say officials,“turning the knife-blade inward”to gouge out those deemed corrupt or insufficiently loyal to the party and its leader, Xi Jinping.

4
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:59,290
More than eight years into Mr Xi’s iron rule, the party appears to wonder whether a vital bulwark of its power is entirely trustworthy.

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:14,530
State-controlled media have described it as the biggest such campaign since the late 1990s within the domestic-security system, which includes the police, the secret police, the judiciary and prisons.

6
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,420
It is due to last for about a year.

7
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:26,290
The aim is to ensure that these agencies are“absolutely loyal, absolutely pure and absolutely reliable”.

8
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,780
Officials say the campaign will be like the“Yan’an Rectification”of the early 1940s.

9
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:43,320
That was when Mao—then the leader of a communist insurgency—staged a sweeping and brutal purge of the party’s ranks to consolidate his control.

10
00:01:44,250 --> 00:02:04,020
Such language suggests that many heads will roll as the party attempts to clear the“dense miasma”surrounding the security apparatus, cure it of“chronic illness”and ensure it remains“surnamed Party”(meaning as loyal to the party as if to a family member).

11
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,170
It is remarkable that such a campaign is deemed necessary.

12
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:17,910
After he took over as China’s leader in 2012 Mr Xi launched the country’s toughest battle against corruption in decades.

13
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:24,629
Hundreds of thousands of officials were punished, including powerful people with security backgrounds.

14
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,420
One of them was Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee.

15
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,290
Before Mr Xi assumed power, Mr Zhou had overseen the entire law-enforcement apparatus.

16
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:45,020
In 2015 he was sentenced to life in prison—ostensibly for graft and leaking state secrets.

17
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,360
Officials later alleged—without giving details—that he had engaged in“political plotting”, too.

18
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,170
It is widely believed that he was an opponent of Mr Xi.

19
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:09,220
But on February 3rd party investigators said the police had failed to eliminate Mr Zhou’s“pernicious influence”within the force and had not followed the party line“satisfactorily enough”.

20
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:17,570
Several high-ranking security officials have been snared by the party’s anti-corruption agency in the past few months.

21
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:25,240
The most prominent is Gong Daoan, then Shanghai’s police chief and one of the city’s deputy mayors.

22
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:36,210
Last August he became the third policeman with a rank equivalent to that of a vice-minister to be placed under investigation since the start of 2020.

23
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,260
The following month Mr Gong was stripped of his posts.

24
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,000
On March 1st the government announced that he had been arrested and his case referred to prosecutors.

25
00:03:47,880 --> 00:04:07,640
The charges against Mr Gong include abuse of his positions to promote his and others’ business interests, corruption related to the approval of appointments, misuse of his official car and frequent attendance of banquets that raised questions about his impartiality.

26
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:28,200
But Mr Gong’s alleged political offences are listed first: forming factions within the party and“completely lacking the four awarenesses”, ie, of the need for loyalty to the party and to Mr Xi, and for compliance with their orders and total adherence to the party’s line.

27
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:34,040
Such accusations will probably be levelled at more police chiefs during the upcoming purge.

28
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:49,790
The loyalty of the security agencies“directly affects the party’s position at the helm of state and the continuance of political stability”, said an official report on a meeting of party bosses that kicked off the nationwide campaign.

29
00:04:50,330 --> 00:05:06,489
Its launch was heralded in July with trial runs in a handful of local police forces, courts and prosecutors’ offices, as well as in two prisons and one local state-security bureau (home to the dissident- and spy-hunting secret police).

30
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:29,290
In charge of this experimental phase was Chen Yixin, a senior security official who appears to be a troubleshooter for Mr Xi—in February last year, in the early days of the covid-19 pandemic, he was sent to Wuhan to help supervise efforts to crush and contain the central city’s massive outbreak of the disease.

31
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:38,089
Mr Chen said“education and rectification”of the security forces was a task of“urgency and extreme importance”.

32
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:48,320
He described the campaign as“scraping the bones to remove the poison, and draining away the filth to bring in fresh water”.

33
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:57,190
Police at the time were reaching the end of a three-year campaign against criminal gangs and their“protective umbrellas”within the government.

34
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,900
That effort resulted in the smashing of more than 14,700 criminal groups.

35
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,570
But apparently it did not succeed in purifying the police.

36
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:19,370
Assuming the campaign will follow the pattern of last year’s experiments, participants can expect to spend a month studying the kind of behaviour that is expected of them.

37
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:25,900
They will then perform“self-examination”and be required to admit to any wrongdoing.

38
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:33,179
These confessions will be compared with other submissions, including complaints from members of the public.

39
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:38,730
High-level teams will be dispatched from Beijing to ensure the job is done properly.

40
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:50,430
Among the 16,000 people who were involved in the trial phase, more than 2,200 were disciplined, including 39 who were formally charged.

41
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:01,980
The campaign may benefit Mr Xi.

42
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:16,660
Late next year he will preside over a five-yearly party congress, which will mark a critical juncture of his leadership.

43
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:23,920
Normally he would be expected to step down at this event, having served as general secretary for a decade.

44
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,980
But he shows no intention of doing so.

45
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:32,250
There have been few obvious signs of opposition to granting him another five-year term.

46
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:42,400
The contrast between China’s successful control of the coronavirus and the West’s fumbling response may have further strengthened his hand.

47
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:52,280
But by tightening his grip on the security forces he can be even more certain that no one will dare to oppose him.
