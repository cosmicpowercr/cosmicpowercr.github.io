1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:32,420
BARACK OBAMA tried to pivot to Asia, but the Arab Spring, Syrian civil war, Islamic State and Iran’s nuclear programme kept dragging him back.

2
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,050
For all the noise Donald Trump made about ending the“forever wars”, he edged towards war with Iran.

3
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:47,330
He dispatched 14,000 troops to the region and, in the end, did not much change the sprawling American military commitment there.

4
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:56,710
Now, even more than his predecessors, President Joe Biden is signalling an intention to downgrade the Middle East among America’s priorities.

5
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:15,860
He took so long to make his first phone call to the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, that his spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, felt compelled, in response to a reporter, to declare the president meant no“intentional diss”(as though an unintended oversight might not be even more humiliating).

6
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,260
Mr Biden finally placed the call on February 17th, almost a month after his inauguration.

7
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:39,660
He waited another week to call King Salman of Saudi Arabia, just before his administration declassified a report accusing the king’s son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, of approving the operation that resulted in the dismemberment of a journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.

8
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:50,310
Mr Biden, who promised during the campaign to make Saudi Arabia“the pariah that they are”, disappointed many of his supporters by not punishing the crown prince.

9
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,280
But he is not looking to further roil the Middle East by threatening America’s long-standing alliances.

10
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,840
Instead, he wants the allies to learn to expect a new detachment from the Americans.

11
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:11,280
Mr Biden has frozen a shipment of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia and has also ordered a review of weapons sales to the United Arab Emirates.

12
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:18,970
He has shown little interest in chasing peace between Israelis and Palestinians, a grail pursued by the past five presidents.

13
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:26,960
His defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has begun a review of American deployments that is expected to consider a shift from the Gulf.

14
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:37,270
“That’s a lot for leaders in the region to digest,”said Martin Indyk of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was Mr Obama’s special envoy to Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

15
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,120
And yet it comes as little surprise, given the shift in thinking of left-leaning Middle East experts.

16
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:59,780
Mr Indyk, a former ambassador to Israel who devoted much of his career to seeking peace, published an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal last year on which the jaded headline summarised an emerging consensus:“The Middle East Isn’t Worth It Anymore”.

17
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:09,329
This view holds that America’s core interests in the region—protecting Saudi oil and the state of Israel—are diminishing as concerns.

18
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:19,260
America still has an interest in the stability of the global oil market, but it imports more oil from Mexico than from Saudi Arabia and fracks plenty of its own.

19
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,500
Israel, the only nuclear power in the region, is not in existential peril.

20
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:35,769
Further, the Middle East is now riven less by an Israeli-Arab divide than a Sunni-Shia one, with Israel lined up alongside Sunni Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, against Iran.

21
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:54,329
In the magazine Foreign Affairs last year, Jake Sullivan, now Mr Biden’s national security adviser, and Daniel Benaim, now the deputy assistant secretary of state for Arabian Peninsula Affairs, wrote that the shift in interests did not mean America“should leave the region outright”.

22
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,280
But skilful diplomacy, they concluded,“will ultimately allow for sustained military reductions”.

23
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,779
Yet a familiar obstacle is blocking the exit: Iran.

24
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:17,530
Among Mr Biden’s first orders of business—unfinished business, for many members of his foreign-policy team—is to curb Iran’s nuclear programme and contend with its proxies, starting in Yemen.

25
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:27,450
The agreement to constrain Iran’s programme, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was among the proudest foreign-policy achievements of the Obama administration.

26
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:36,510
Mr Trump called the deal“horrible and laughable”and in 2018 he pulled out of it, reimposing sanctions which had been dropped or waived.

27
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,940
He went on to impose further sanctions, in what he called a campaign of maximum pressure.

28
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:49,870
Even as Iran’s currency collapsed and covid-19 raged, the country responded with“maximum resistance”.

29
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,180
It began enriching more uranium, and to greater purity, than allowed by the deal.

30
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,360
It has also violated the agreed terms on its use of centrifuges.

31
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:11,950
Today Iran stands closer to being able to build a nuclear bomb than it did when Mr Trump left the agreement, though it continues to insist it wants to use nuclear power only for civilian purposes.

32
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:19,090
The Biden administration has said it is willing to restart negotiations alongside the same allies.

33
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:28,680
But at the end of February Iran rejected the idea of face-to-face talks with the Americans unless they commit themselves in advance to lifting some sanctions.

34
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,870
Administration officials say Iran must comply with the agreement before they will relieve any sanctions.

35
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:42,250
Each side believes the other wants to restore the deal, and both are manoeuvring to discover which wants it more.

36
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:54,950
Presidential elections in Iran in June may create some deadline pressure, since at a minimum installing a new government, which is expected to be more hard-line, would interrupt and delay any negotiations.

37
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,059
This argues for a busy period of diplomacy in the spring.

38
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:08,440
“I’ve seen this movie before,”said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group (ICG), an NGO based in Brussels.

39
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,690
He recalled that before the original deal each side also insisted that the other must move first.

40
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:22,000
He added,“When I look at the cast of characters in this administration, I can’t imagine they’d let the agreement collapse on their watch.”

41
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:31,159
Until recently, Mr Vaez’s boss at the ICG was Rob Malley, a veteran of Middle East negotiations under Bill Clinton and Mr Obama.

42
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:37,130
Mr Malley, who also helped achieve the original agreement, is now Mr Biden’s special envoy for Iran.

43
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:46,099
Shortly before Mr Malley left the ICG, it issued an unsigned report describing steps America should take to return to the deal.

44
00:06:46,490 --> 00:07:00,100
These include a commitment from the Biden administration to support an emergency loan from the IMF sought by Iran to cope with the pandemic, followed by a negotiated timetable for Iran to reverse its breaches of the accord.

45
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:12,380
America would provide some sanctions relief each time the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran had rolled back a violation, in a process that might take two to three months.

46
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:22,939
Centrifudge Then, after a new Iranian president has taken office, America and its allies could pursue what the administration calls a“longer and stronger”follow-on agreement.

47
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:33,200
Such a deal might exchange economic normalisation for long-term guarantees of the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme and limits on its ballistic missiles.

48
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:42,880
Though some Biden officials had argued for attempting first to strike the fuller deal, that debate appears to have been resolved in favour of the incremental approach.

49
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:54,390
Renewing nuclear diplomacy with Iran, Mr Biden’s advisers believe, would create a basis for America to press for talks among regional powers to end their proxy conflicts.

50
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:02,200
The Americans want to begin with Yemen, where Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have been fighting the Saudi-backed government for seven years.

51
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:10,110
Yemen weighs on the consciences of many Biden officials because of support the Obama administration gave to the Saudi-led effort.

52
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:18,130
The Trump administration intensified that support, and today the United Nations regards Yemen as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

53
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:26,520
Mr Biden has appointed an envoy to push for peace in Yemen, and there are hints of progress, at least among the outside powers.

54
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,580
The combatants themselves, however, have yet to show much interest in halting the fighting.

55
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:44,740
According to the vision of Mr Sullivan, the national security adviser, a new framework for regional powers to address their differences, together with nuclear diplomacy, would allow America to begin to pull back.

56
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:58,190
The Middle East, he and Mr Benaim wrote in Foreign Affairs, is“the world’s most dangerously under-institutionalised region”, with nothing like the African Union or the Organisation of American States to police norms.

57
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,680
Any effective regional organisation is a long way off.

58
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,370
If anything, would-be members seem more inclined than ever to go their own ways.

59
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:20,570
The UAE last year normalised relations with Israel and last month put a spacecraft into orbit around Mars, while Egypt, preoccupied with its economic woes, has vanished from its historic leadership role.

60
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:39,580
Saudi Arabia and Iran retain strong interests in preserving enmity between the United States and Iran, since the former—like the UAE and Israel—benefits from the costly protection of American forces, while the Iranian regime derives legitimacy from its standoff with the Great Satan.

61
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:52,980
Add on the crisis in Yemen, the suppurating wound that is Syria, the precarity of Iraq, the assertiveness of Turkey and a building humanitarian and human-rights disaster in Ethiopia: Mr.

62
00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:01,090
Biden will have to pay more attention than he would like to the neighborhood if America has any hope, however thin, of someday paying it less.

63
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:07,199
Or else he will have to embrace the role of ruthless realist, and walk away.

64
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:16,820
His treatment of the Saudi crown prince—shaming him but not punishing him, respecting the regime but urging reform—looks like an attempt to split the difference.

65
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:34,890
And already a familiar, violent pattern is asserting itself: last week America dispatched F-15 fighters to drop bombs in eastern Syria on facilities used by Iraqi militias linked to Iran, in response to rocket attacks by Iran-backed groups against Americans in Iraq.

66
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,710
Mr Biden said he meant to warn Iran to“be careful”.

67
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:51,140
American administrations find it easier to talk about shifting their attention from the Middle East than to do so in practice, says Senator Chris Murphy, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

68
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,680
“There’s always a crisis,”says Mr Murphy.

69
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,290
“There’s always something new and exciting happening in the Middle East.

70
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,650
Whereas China’s trajectory is slow and quiet and steady.”
