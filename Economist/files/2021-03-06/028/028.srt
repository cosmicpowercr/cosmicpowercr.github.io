00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:27,960
IN THE HILLY village of Iitate, in Fukushima prefecture, stands a new community centre built with parts pulled from abandoned buildings.

2
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,930
Windows from one, doors from another.

3
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,099
A chalkboard from a beloved school with no children to attend it.

4
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,060
One cloudy day last autumn, a crowd gathered to celebrate its opening.

5
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:55,539
As an elderly woman in a green kimono sang folk tunes, her voice riding a beat or two behind the music, the audience, a mix of locals and Tokyo-ites involved in the centre’s design, feasted on chestnut-filled rice balls.

6
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,350
Iitate is a farming district once known for its fine beef and dried radish.

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,360
In 2010 it qualified for membership of a club called“Most beautiful villages of Japan”.

8
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:11,390
Yet its recent history has been far from bucolic.

9
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:19,890
Some 35km to the south-east, across the verdant Abukuma mountains, stands the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant.

10
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:26,979
Opened in 1971, it was one of dozens built around Japan to power the post-war economy.

11
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:35,780
The government offered municipalities generous subsidies for hosting the plants, and promised people that they posed no risks.

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,750
By 2011 Japan had 54 working reactors, providing a third of the country’s electricity.

13
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:49,489
At 2:46pm on March 11th of that year, an earthquake shook Japan’s north-eastern coast.

14
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:57,490
The quake triggered a tsunami, sending waves as high as 40 metres crashing along 500km of coastline.

15
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,389
Homes and roads were obliterated.

16
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:09,390
Though the plant withstood the waves, its back-up generators were flooded, halting the essential flow of cooling water around its six reactors.

17
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:16,740
Within days, three of them had melted down, spreading radiation across the region and panic around the world.

18
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,069
Thousands fled their homes.

19
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:25,029
A few of them went first to Iitate, but the wind carried radioactive particles in its direction.

20
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:29,080
Eventually the authorities ordered the evacuation of Iitate, too.

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:39,890
Residents were allowed to return six years later, but only 1,500 have done so—a fraction of the 6,200 who called it home before the disaster.

22
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:52,630
“The radiation effects are not visible, but I hope you can see how deeply it is felt,”says Tao Yoichi of Resurrection of Fukushima, the NGO that organised the construction of the community centre.

23
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,890
The earthquake literally reshaped the country: Japan’s biggest island moved 2,4 metres to the east.

24
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,730
At the time, a similarly seismic shift in Japanese society was predicted.

25
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:15,569
Politicians painted efforts to rehabilitate Fukushima as an emblem of a broader revival after a period of economic stagnation and demographic decline.

26
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:31,660
Commentators spoke of 3/11, as the disaster came to be known, as a historical turning point, a shared experience that would shape a generation, a shock that would reinvigorate sclerotic institutions and open closed minds.

27
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,800
Japan’s“post-war”period had given way to a new,“post-disaster”era, went one popular coinage.

28
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:54,500
Kurokawa Kiyoshi, chairman of the parliamentary committee that investigated the disaster, spoke of 3/11 as a possible“third opening”, akin to the abolition of the shogunate in 1868 and Japan’s defeat in the second world war.

29
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:59,600
Ten years after 3/11, the third opening has yet to materialise.

30
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:12,530
“I expected that Japan would finally start to change and I pinned hope on that prospect—but I’m afraid I was proven to be wrong,”says Funabashi Yoichi, chairman of an independent investigation into the accident.

31
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,880
“The first instinct was just to restore, not to reform.”

32
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,909
Mr Kurokawa agrees:“No, the crisis did not change Japan”.

33
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,630
It was, perhaps, too much to expect a revolution.

34
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:33,600
The 3/11 disaster revealed internal failings, mostly of an intractable, structural sort, but also resilience.

35
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,700
And though it battered Japan, it did not amount to complete defeat, as in the second world war.

36
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:49,350
By chance, it occurred during only the second brief period in Japan’s post-war history when the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was not in power.

37
00:04:49,680 --> 00:05:01,940
The association of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), in office from 2009 to 2012, with the disaster helped to discredit the idea of reform and political alternation.

38
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:13,540
“Nuclear policy was implemented for many years by the LDP, but the DPJ had to take responsibility [for the disaster],”says Nakabayashi Mieko, a former MP with the DPJ.

39
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,670
“Afterwards, people thought that while democracy in Japan was important, stability should have priority.”

40
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:31,980
“There’s been some change, but nothing at the pace commensurate with the promise,”argues Richard Samuels, author of“3,11: Disaster and Change in Japan”.

41
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,970
A new regulator brought stricter oversight to the nuclear industry.

42
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:40,929
But the LDP remains wedded to nuclear power despite public scepticism.

43
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,610
Disaster preparedness has improved.

44
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:55,210
But the same flaws that handicapped the response to the disaster—weak central authority, lack of co-ordination among ministries, poor communication, bureaucratic inflexibility—persist.

45
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:05,090
And the political impetus for reform has dissipated, as the LDP has regained power, the DPJ has disintegrated and apathy has set in.

46
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:13,170
Miyagi and Iwate, the two other prefectures that suffered most from the earthquake and tsunami, have largely recovered.

47
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,810
Fukushima itself has struggled.

48
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,640
A small area is still uninhabitable.

49
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:30,760
Kowata Masumi’s husband’s family had lived for more than 200 years in the same house in Okuma, one of the two towns next to the plant, growing persimmons, weaving silk and brewing sake.

50
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:39,550
It is now in the“difficult-to-return”zone (see map), subject to 50 times more radiation than is typically considered safe.

51
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,289
Former residents are allowed to make short visits in protective gear, but not to stay overnight.

52
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:54,439
Ms Kowata, one of Okuma’s town councillors, found a monkey in her living room on one such trip,“wearing our clothes like the king of the house”.

53
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,460
For the most part, however, the problem is no longer contamination.

54
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,460
Only 2,4% of the land area of the prefecture remains off-limits to residents.

55
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:11,300
Only 36,811 people, or 2,1% of the population, are still unable to return home.

56
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,800
Just one worker has died from direct radiation exposure.

57
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,830
Cancer rates in the region have not spiked.

58
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:25,340
Ambient radiation in most of the prefecture is comparable with other cities in Japan and around the world.

59
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,540
The health risks are much less acute than what was feared in the disaster’s aftermath.

60
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:38,410
In retrospect, it was the chaotic evacuation that probably harmed public health most.

61
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:48,329
In Fukushima prefecture 2,317 people died as a result of it, mostly because of disruption to medical care or suicide.

62
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:56,330
That is more than the 1,606 who perished during the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown themselves.

63
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,650
Some researchers argue the government should not have ordered a large-scale evacuation at all, or should have limited it to weeks rather than years.

64
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:14,090
Yet it would have been hard to tell a fearful population, faced with the invisible threat of radiation, to stay put or return quickly.

65
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,729
The meltdown destroyed confidence in experts.

66
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:27,690
The lack of candour from officials in the early weeks and months after the disaster sapped trust in the authorities, pushing citizens to fill the gaps themselves.

67
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:40,460
“There were so many things that weren’t convincing, so we decided to get our own data,”says Kobayashi Tomoko, an inn-owner and radiation monitor from Minamisoma, a city north of the plant.

68
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:54,080
Even when the government lifted evacuation orders years later, putting an end to compensation payments for residents of those areas, some protested against what they saw as a ploy to force people to return under unsafe conditions.

69
00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:06,800
“Sensitivity to radioactivity depends on mindset, it’s difficult to treat as matter of policy,”says Iio Jun of the Reconstruction Design Council, a government advisory panel set up after the disaster.

70
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,440
“There are more emotional elements.”

71
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:17,180
In the past decade the government’s efforts at reconstruction have focused on infrastructure and decontaminating land.

72
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,740
Official presentations teem with graphics showing rebuilt roads and railways.

73
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,170
Fully 96% of the planned public works have been completed.

74
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:34,480
Millions of tonnes of waste from the disaster have been removed, including millions of cubic metres of radioactive topsoil.

75
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,810
Recovery, by these measures, is progressing well.

76
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:47,480
The Olympic Games (originally scheduled for 2020, but delayed until this summer owing to covid-19) are meant to be the culmination of the area’s rehabilitation.

77
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:58,140
The government has promoted them as the“Recovery Olympics”and plans to begin the torch relay in Fukushima at a stadium that became a base for disaster relief in 2011.

78
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:04,699
The flame will pass through Okuma, Iitate and Minamisoma on its way to Tokyo.

79
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,779
Yet the emphasis on physical reconstruction misses the point.

80
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:21,410
“People’s hearts and spirits are not only not recovering, they’re being lost even more,”laments Sakurai Katsunobu, who was mayor of Minamisoma during 3/11.

81
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,730
Rates of depression and anxiety among residents of Fukushima are more than double the national average.

82
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:35,500
Diseases such as diabetes and hypertension have become more common, presumably because of continuing anxiety and disruption.

83
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,959
Families have been separated, livelihoods lost.

84
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,050
“Real recovery is not about making buildings, not about physical things,”says Ms Kowata.

85
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,770
“Who is this infrastructure actually being built for?”

86
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,630
asks Mr Sakurai.

87
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:58,670
Many of those ordered to evacuate in the aftermath of the disaster, as well as others who fled the region of their own accord, have stayed away.

88
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,860
In the areas where evacuation was ordered, only a quarter or so of the population has returned, mostly the elderly.

89
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:16,610
As elsewhere in rural Japan, the prefecture’s population had been falling anyway, dipping by an average of 100,000 people in the nine years preceding the disaster.

90
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:26,220
But 3/11 has accelerated the decline: in the nine years since, the population has fallen by an average of 180,000 a year (see chart 1).

91
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,110
Rebuilding communities has proved far trickier than repaving roads.

92
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,520
“Ten years is just the starting point,”says Mr Tao of Resurrection of Fukushima.

93
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:41,249
“Only now are villages beginning to be able to think about the future.”

94
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:47,540
Many have shifted from trying to get former residents to return towards attracting new arrivals.

95
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,350
There have been successes.

96
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,579
Near the community centre in Iitate, a group of young artists has converted a former school into studios.

97
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:08,380
In Minamisoma, Wada Tomoyuki, an entrepreneur, runs a co-working space and small-business incubator where most of his partners are newcomers who wanted to escape office-bound city life.

98
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,079
Yet progress is slow.

99
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:22,850
Mr Wada launched Odaka Worker’s Base in 2014, hoping to assist 100 new businesses to help tackle local problems; so far, 15 have set up shop.

100
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:30,520
The government touts a higher-tech future along the Fukushima“innovation coast”, a cluster of research and development centres.

101
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,820
But most are engaged in projects connected to disaster relief or the nuclear plant’s decommissioning.

102
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:45,149
The decommissioning itself“casts a heavy, dark shadow over the future”, says Uchibori Masao, Fukushima’s governor.

103
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:54,370
The removal of 900 tonnes of melted fuel from the three reactors that failed—the most radioactive part of the wreckage—has yet to begin.

104
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:02,430
TEPCO, the utility that owns the plant, thinks it will take 30-40 years, but even that may be optimistic.

105
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:14,760
Last year, the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), the new regulator set up after the accident, reported higher than expected levels of radiation on the temporary caps placed over two of the reactors.

106
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,920
Such findings complicate plans for decommissioning.

107
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:25,440
The fate of the decontaminated soil, which has been piled in black bags around the region, remains unresolved too.

108
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:33,690
This year the bags are being taken to“interim storage facilities”in the“difficult to return”zone, meaning dumps in uninhabitable areas.

109
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:41,699
By law, the soil must be sent outside the prefecture by 2045, but the government has yet to work out where to take it.

110
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:49,760
The most pressing problem is the contaminated water that has seeped into the plant or has been used to cool spent fuel.

111
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,860
There is already more than 1m tonnes of it, and storage space will run out next year.

112
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:02,660
TEPCO filters it to remove all radioactive particles bar one isotope, tritium.

113
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:09,430
The government wants to tip the filtered water into the ocean—standard practice at nuclear plants around the world.

114
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,630
Yet fishermen and farmers fear this will make people loth to buy their wares.

115
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,449
Activists worry that the tanks hold nasty surprises.

116
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:31,470
After years of insisting the water contained only tritium, TEPCO revealed in 2018 that it would have to re-filter most of it, since it had not been treated properly and was more dangerous than had been admitted.

117
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,319
Such episodes have fed mistrust of the government’s assurances about public health in Fukushima.

118
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:43,460
The screening of food from the prefecture is thorough and safety standards are high.

119
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:50,440
The Fukushima Agricultural Technology Centre, a government body, tests 100-200 samples a day.

120
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:57,899
Workers in rubber gloves chop up peaches, mushrooms and rice and feed them into devices that detect radiation.

121
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,340
The last elevated result was six years ago.

122
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,300
Independent monitors also judge local food to be safe.

123
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,860
Yet products from Fukushima are still generally cheaper than those from elsewhere.

124
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:15,899
The enduring mistrust extends to nuclear power in general.

125
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,670
Before 3/11 more than two-thirds of Japanese wanted to preserve or even expand it.

126
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,100
The government wanted nuclear plants to generate half of Japan’s power by the middle of the century.

127
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:38,690
A majority is now against it, including bigwigs such as Koizumi Junichiro, a former prime minister from the LDP, and Kan Naoto, who was prime minister at the time of the disaster.

128
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,800
“I had supposed Japanese engineers were very high quality.

129
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,750
I thought it was unlikely that human error could cause an accident in Japan,”says Mr Kan.

130
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,110
“My thinking changed 180 degrees.”

131
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,640
The current government has not, however, given up on nuclear power.

132
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,440
To this day only nine of Japan’s 54 reactors have been allowed to restart.

133
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,860
They provided just 6% of the country’s electricity last year.

134
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:27,450
Nearly half of the rest are to be shut down; the others are in various forms of administrative limbo.

135
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,470
The current prime minister, Suga Yoshihide, has promised to make Japan carbon neutral by 2050.

136
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:41,440
So he wants to build more wind farms and solar plants—but also to restart more of the idled nuclear reactors.

137
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:52,330
“Zero carbon by 2050 means we need nuclear,”argues Toyoda Masakazu, who chairs the Institute of Energy Economics, a think-tank in Tokyo.

138
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,060
Some towns are eager to go nuclear again.

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:14,540
“After five or six years, people started thinking about how much risk we can bear in terms of economic growth,”says Nose Yutaka, mayor of Takahama, which recently became the first town to approve the restart of a nuclear plant that is more than 40 years old, the standard regulatory lifetime in Japan.

140
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:20,150
The nuclear industry insists it has learned the lessons of 3/11.

141
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:26,790
TEPCO says that the expectation of perfection, which stifled the reporting of problems, has been swept away.

142
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:33,780
It and other power companies have poured billions of dollars into new seawalls, filter systems and other safety features.

143
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,330
Local governments have drawn up proper evacuation plans.

144
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:46,360
“Before Fukushima, it was assumed that if government officials are creating plans, accidents are bound to happen, so no one made plans,”Mr Nose says.

145
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,330
“Now we have one.”

146
00:17:48,850 --> 00:18:01,430
The existence of risk is not a reason to abandon a technology, argues TEPCO’s Anegawa Takefumi:“In ancient times, Prometheus gave us fire, and many people die from fires, but we accept that.”

147
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:11,480
Anti-nuclear activists hold that the risks of using nuclear power in Japan, one of the world’s most seismically active countries, are prohibitive.

148
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:22,340
“Using technology that has potential to destroy your society is insane—that’s the risk we’re talking about,”says Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace, a pressure group.

149
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:29,180
The sudden promotion of nuclear power as climate-friendly strikes many in Fukushima as cynical.

150
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:37,530
“We shouldn’t have to choose between climate disaster and nuclear disaster,”says Muto Ruiko, a local anti-nuclear campaigner.

151
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:44,360
There is plenty of scope, anti-nuclear campaigners point out, to generate more renewable energy.

152
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:50,079
After 3/11 the government introduced incentives for renewables and liberalised the electricity market.

153
00:18:50,509 --> 00:19:09,529
Though renewables now provide more than 20% of Japan’s power, their share would be higher still, argues Iida Tetsunari of the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, if the regional retail monopolies’ grip on the grid was loosened further and connections between regions expanded.

154
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:19,190
He says a reform that came into force last year, obliging the big utilities to manage generation and transmission as separate units, has had little effect.

155
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,659
“Local utilities people still use the same name-card, the same email address,”says Mr Iida.

156
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,979
“The grid must become more independent.”

157
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:42,160
Plans released late last year foresee 50-60% of generation coming from renewables in 2050, with nuclear or fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture technology providing the remainder.

158
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:50,920
A clearer picture is expected this summer, when the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry releases a new triennial strategy for power generation.

159
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,020
The minister, Kajiyama Hiroshi, has expressed support for more nuclear power.

160
00:19:56,389 --> 00:20:06,840
Even those who favour a renewable-powered Japan in the long term may accept a handful of restarts now, if that means closing coal-fired plants more quickly.

161
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:15,429
Getting new reactors built would be much trickier, however, seeing that most Japanese people are against nuclear power.

162
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:28,690
In either case, oversight will fall to the NRA, which was set up specifically to prevent the sort of chumminess with utilities that allowed the failings at Fukushima Dai-ichi to go undetected or uncorrected.

163
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:39,400
Fuketa Toyoshi, the NRA’s chairman, is careful not to get embroiled in politics:“We believe we have to be independent of discussions in energy policy.”

164
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:49,950
Unfortunately for the NRA and for policymakers, one seismic change that has endured since 3/11 is a loss of faith in institutions in general.

165
00:20:50,380 --> 00:21:02,870
A yearly survey by Edelman, a public-relations firm, found that the share of Japanese expressing trust in their government plunged from 51% before the disaster to 25% after.

166
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,560
It now stands at 37%.

167
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:17,039
“This is the key problem: the loss of trust,”says Azby Brown of Safecast, an NGO in Tokyo that spearheaded independent efforts to monitor radiation after the disaster.

168
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,480
“Trust is not a renewable resource.

169
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,780
Once you lose it, that’s it.”
