1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,420
WHICH ECONOMY contracted most sharply last year?

2
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,780
That dubious honour almost certainly belongs to Macau, a former Portuguese colony that is now part of China.

3
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:37,950
On March 5th the autonomous region’s statistical agency is expected to announce that GDP fell by at least half from 2019.

4
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:46,789
Unsurprising, perhaps, given that the covid-19 pandemic has dealt a blow to Macau’s sole engine of growth: casinos.

5
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:58,370
Gross gaming revenue in Macau, the only place in China where casinos are legal, plummeted from $36bn in 2019 to $7,5bn last year.

6
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,050
The first two months of 2021 brought little respite.

7
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:12,210
Yet despite collapsing revenues and heavy pre-tax losses, share prices of Macau’s six casino operators have held up remarkably well (see chart).

8
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:15,190
Three of them are worth more than they were before the pandemic.

9
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:25,040
Recently, after reporting that annual revenues had fallen by three-quarters, the biggest, Galaxy Entertainment, saw its market value swell to $42bn.

10
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:38,320
Investors also reacted with a collective shrug when MGM China, a listed subsidiary of Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts International, disclosed a similar drop in its top line.

11
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,009
Why are investors feeling lucky?

12
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:50,410
First, Macau expects a speedy recovery in visitors from mainland China, who account for seven in ten non-Macanese punters.

13
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,300
For much of 2020 virus-induced travel restrictions stemmed their flow.

14
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,540
Last month Macau exempted all mainland visitors from quarantine.

15
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:05,459
Today the casino hub is the only jurisdiction with which the mainland has a two-way travel bubble.

16
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,380
The second reason for thinking the odds of recovery are good relates to a new directive from the central government in Beijing.

17
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:23,120
Last summer it created a“blacklist”of overseas gambling destinations that were“endangering the personal safety and property of Chinese citizens”.

18
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,720
A second blacklist of prohibited destinations was added in January.

19
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:37,560
Neither list has been made public—perhaps because the government concluded that international leisure travel is still impractical and thus did not feel compelled to say more.

20
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,580
But most gambling-industry watchers assume that Macau has been spared.

21
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:48,110
Indeed, some believe that the blacklist may have been drawn up specifically to shelter the city.

22
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,720
Either way, one long-term effect could be the repatriation of the demand for gaming.

23
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:57,719
Macau may need to overcome a countervailing force.

24
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:10,190
A new law that took effect in mainland China on March 1st prohibits any individual or group from“organising Chinese citizens”to partake in overseas gambling, on pain of imprisonment.

25
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:17,809
Unlike the blacklist, this regulation appears to apply to all jurisdictions outside the mainland, including Macau.

26
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:24,030
Casinos there often rely on agents in mainland China to organise such jamborees.

27
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,880
They will now be forced to keep a lower profile.

28
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,900
Still, investors appear to be betting that enough individual Chinese like a flutter.

29
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,130
They greeted the new law with another shrug.
