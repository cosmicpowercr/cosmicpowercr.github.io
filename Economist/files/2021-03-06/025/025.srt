00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:26,930
GONE IS THE carnival atmosphere that pervaded Yangon, Myanmar’s biggest city, during the first weeks of protests against a military coup on February 1st.

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:39,410
The protesters have exchanged tongue-in-cheek placards for home-made shields and tiaras for hard hats, the better to fend off the increasingly violent security forces.

3
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:52,310
For most of the past month the army—notorious for violently crushing past democracy movements—had responded with water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas, but nothing worse.

4
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,320
But as the demonstrations have worn on, the junta has grown more vicious.

5
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,130
Soldiers have begun firing live ammunition into crowds.

6
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,840
On March 3rd, the bloodiest day so far, at least 38 people were killed, according to a UN official.

7
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:15,310
The army, or Tatmadaw as it is known, clearly hopes the shootings will persuade the protesters to go home.

8
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,700
Some have: the streets are no longer thronged with hundreds of thousands of them, as they were in late February, but they are far from empty.

9
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:29,410
Young protesters are just as likely to be demonstrating as older, hardened activists.

10
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:42,240
A giggly 17-year-old university student who was consumed by her passion for K-pop until the coup says she became a“little bit afraid”after her friend was tear-gassed.

11
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,650
Despite the danger, she insists,“I have to protest.”

12
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:48,609
She is still doing so most days.

13
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:52,940
Opponents of the coup are steeling themselves for a long fight.

14
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:59,770
They hope that, by convincing enough workers to go on strike, they can throw a spanner in the machinery of state.

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,880
Teachers, doctors, railway workers, truck drivers, customs agents and other bureaucrats have not been going into work for weeks.

16
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,410
Neither have many employees at banks, whether state-owned or private.

17
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:21,369
As a result, most of the country’s 2,000 private bank branches have been shut since February 8th, according to Frontier, a local magazine.

18
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,260
Banks have also placed caps on withdrawals from cash machines or suspended them altogether.

19
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,830
There are other signs of economic distress.

20
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,849
Over the past month the kyat has depreciated by at least 6,5% against the dollar.

21
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:42,179
Imports of fuel, on which Myanmar relies heavily, have stalled.

22
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:48,400
The World Bank is no longer disbursing funds for $350m-worth of projects.

23
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:56,169
Some foreign investors, especially those in business with conglomerates owned by the army, are packing their bags.

24
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:09,710
Lim Kaling, a Singaporean businessman, is relinquishing his stake in a tobacco company in which one such conglomerate, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL), is the biggest shareholder.

25
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,300
Kirin, a Japanese brewer, has also withdrawn from a joint venture with MEHL.

26
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:24,580
The civil-disobedience movement“is starting to paralyse the state”, writes Richard Horsey of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank.

27
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,459
There are doubts about how long the generals will be able to pay wages.

28
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:40,600
This is particularly embarrassing since Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief, would like to be seen as a better manager of the economy than Aung San Suu Kyi, the civilian leader he overthrew.

29
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,020
The longer the strike goes on, the more inept and weak he looks.

30
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,140
The rising death toll is not the only sign of the junta’s mounting frustration.

31
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,460
The security services have been trying to force workers back to their jobs.

32
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:08,599
In mid-February, notes Anthony Davis, a security analyst, the exhausted police were reinforced by light-infantry divisions—battle-hardened troops typically dispatched to fight ethnic militias on the country’s periphery.

33
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:17,110
One of the units in question was implicated in a pogrom in 2017 against the Rohingya, a persecuted ethnic minority.

34
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:23,570
There have been reports of violent rampages through neighbourhoods with especially persistent demonstrations.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,099
The army is also using surveillance drones and shutting off the internet between 1am and 9am.

36
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:35,230
The top brass may be hoping that the damage to the economy cuts both ways.

37
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,910
Some participants in the civil-disobedience movement are running out of money.

38
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,849
Htay Win, who owns a roadside tea shop in Yangon, has almost no savings left.

39
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,290
His business was closed for seven months last year, owing to covid-19 restrictions.

40
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,390
He closed it again in early February so that he could join the protests.

41
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,439
Given his parlous finances, he thinks he will have to re-open soon, at least part-time.

42
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,160
Many other demonstrators have no intention of giving up the fight.

43
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:17,320
Almost a month after the start of the civil-disobedience movement, the number of people participating continues to grow, says Moe Thuzar of ISEAS, a think-tank in Singapore.

44
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:27,889
Aye Thidar Oo, a typist at a municipal office in Yangon, declares,“It might be a year, two years, ten years: I will carry on striking until the end.”

45
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:35,800
Nann Yin Htwe, a worker at a garment factory, says her salary was so low that she has nothing to lose by striking.

46
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:44,920
She is receiving food and contributions to her rent from several of the many grassroots aid organisations that have sprung up to help striking workers.

47
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,700
She is proud to be out of work, she says.

48
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:56,480
Mr Davis suspects there are hardliners in the army who advocate swifter, harsher repression to stem the erosion of morale.

49
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:03,800
Two previous agitations for democracy, in 1988 and 2007, ended in massacres.

50
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:10,340
In both cases the army hesitated for over a month before crushing the protests.
