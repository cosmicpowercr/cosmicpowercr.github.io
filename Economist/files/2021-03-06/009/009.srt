1
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,240
IT HAS BEEN ten years since a tsunami laid waste the Pacific coast of northern Honshu, Japan’s most populous island.

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:38,550
The tsunami and the undersea earthquake which triggered it, the largest ever recorded in the region, killed nearly 20,000 people, destroyed over 100,000 homes and threw the lives of tens of millions into turmoil.

3
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:47,890
The direct economic cost, estimated at over $200bn, was larger than that of any other natural disaster the world has seen.

4
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,490
The earthquake cut the plant off from outside sources of electricity.

5
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:13,410
The tsunami easily topped the plant’s sea walls, flooding the underground bunkers containing its emergency generators—a foreseeable risk Japan’s neutered regulators had failed to foresee.

6
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:29,299
Because there was no way to cool the reactor cores, the nuclear fuel within them began to melt; amid fire, explosion and alarming amounts of radiation, a puddle from hell began eating into the plant’s concrete foundations.

7
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:31,549
The world looked on aghast.

8
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:41,700
In Shanghai and San Francisco iodine tablets and iodised salt jumped off the shelves as people looked for prophylaxis of which they had no need.

9
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:51,790
In Germany the chancellor, Angela Merkel, who had long stood with business leaders against the country’s powerful anti-nuclear movement, ordered its reactors phased out.

10
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,699
In China the world’s largest new nuclear-plant programme was put on hold.

11
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,730
Talk of a“nuclear renaissance”to fight climate change fell silent.

12
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,270
The reaction, though understandable, was wrong.

13
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,950
Nuclear power has a lot of drawbacks.

14
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,479
Its large, slowly built plants are expensive both in absolute terms and in terms of the electricity they produce.

15
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:28,090
Its very small but real risk of catastrophic failure requires a high level of regulation, and it has a disturbing history of regulatory capture, amply demonstrated in Japan.

16
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,559
It produces extremely long-lived and toxic waste.

17
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,200
And it is associated with the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

18
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,900
Most of the countries outside Europe that use nuclear power have some history of attempting to develop a bomb.

19
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:51,010
All these factors contribute to an unease with the technology felt, to greater or lesser extent, by people all around the world.

20
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:54,950
Against all that, though, two things must be remembered.

21
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,729
One is that well-regulated nuclear power is safe.

22
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:05,170
With the terrible Soviet-era exception of Chernobyl, nuclear disasters come without large death tolls.

23
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,150
It was the tsunami, not radiation, that claimed nearly all those lives in Fukushima.

24
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:22,590
The other is that the climate is in crisis, and nuclear plants can supply some of the vast amounts of emissions-free electricity the world needs if it is to cope.

25
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,800
Solar and wind power are now much cheaper, but they are intermittent.

26
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:35,849
Providing a reliable grid is a lot easier if some of its generating capacity can be assumed to be available all the time.

27
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:44,260
Nuclear provides such capacity with no ongoing emissions, and it is doing so safely and at scale around the world.

28
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,330
Despite this, safe and productive nuclear plants are being closed across the rich world.

29
00:03:51,130 --> 00:04:01,830
Those closures and the retirement of older sites mean that advanced economies could lose two-thirds of their nuclear capacity by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency.

30
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,020
If new fossil-fuel infrastructure fills the gap, it will last for decades.

31
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:13,950
If renewables do so, the opportunity cost will be measured in gigatonnes of carbon.

32
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:21,950
Renewables replacing nuclear capacity would almost always be better deployed to replace fossil-fuel capacity.

33
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,490
Sometimes the closure of nuclear plants is largely a matter of economics.

34
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:35,370
In places where emitting carbon dioxide comes with no price, such as America, the benefits of being emissions-free are hidden from the market.

35
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,540
That hurts nuclear, and it should be rectified.

36
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:46,320
When closure is political, the onus is on Green politicians, in particular, to change their tune.

37
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:53,390
To hasten the decline of nuclear power is wilfully to hobble the world in the greatest environmental struggle of all.

38
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:04,899
The argument for keeping existing nuclear plants open has been strengthened, in some places, by one of the responses to Fukushima: greater independence for nuclear regulators.

39
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,250
Britain granted new freedom to its regulator after 2011.

40
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,830
So did Japan.

41
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,979
Though grander hopes for reform after the tsunami bore little fruit, Japan did largely take the regulators’ hand from the power companies’ glove.

42
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:28,900
Its new supervisor has made reopening mothballed nuclear power plants harder than the government would like, but that is as it should be.

43
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,130
In Japan more than anywhere, nuclear needs to earn back trust to be useful.

44
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,429
This points to nuclear’s greatest weakness.

45
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:45,330
In democracies it is expensive, owing to regulation and public antipathy, which makes new nuclear power a hard sell.

46
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:54,169
The technology is thus increasingly the preserve of autocracies—precisely the systems where good regulation is least likely.

47
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:02,180
Having paused after Fukushima, China’s nuclear plans accelerated as part of an effort to reduce reliance on coal.

48
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:13,709
China produced four times as much nuclear energy in 2019 as it did in 2011; it has 16 reactors under construction and another 39 planned.

49
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:19,200
Countries wanting new nuclear plants now look to China and Russia as suppliers.

50
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,530
There is a strong case for democracies seeking to replace ageing nuclear plants with non-intermittent equivalents to join the importers.

51
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:36,269
If Chinese reactors are designed in the knowledge that they will have to meet with the approval of independent regulators the world will be a safer place.

52
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:45,419
At the same time, in boosting energy R&D to tackle the climate crisis, Western governments should be sure to give nuclear its fair share.

53
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:58,330
There are real attractions to some new approaches, notably smaller reactors with lower unit costs: in platoons they can replace old plants; singly they can add incremental capacity where needed.

54
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,830
They might perhaps be used to retrofit old fossil-fuel plants.

55
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,969
It’s critical Nuclear power has drawbacks the size of a tsunami.

56
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:16,000
But with Chinese plants being built today that will not be decommissioned until the 22nd century, it cannot simply be wished away.

57
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,300
What is more, it has a vital role to play in the fight for a stable climate.

58
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:28,989
The lesson of Fukushima is not to eschew nuclear power, it is to use it wisely.
