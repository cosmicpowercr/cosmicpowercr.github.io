1
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,509
MOST PEOPLE have little time for quants.

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:25,209
They find the language of quantitative finance far from illuminating.

3
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:31,310
Even fairly numerate people struggle to grasp what comes easily to pointy-headed number-crunchers.

4
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,119
Take the idea of correlation, the co-movement of two or more variables.

5
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,990
Such relationships vary with the period over which they are measured.

6
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,720
The direction can shift.

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,640
Things quickly become confusing.

8
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:57,430
Yet the quant argot is useful when considering perhaps the biggest fear stalking financial markets: a sustained rise in inflation that would be bad for both equities and bonds.

9
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:04,219
A quant might describe this as a flip in the bond-equity correlation from negative to positive.

10
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,080
That is none too elegant, though.

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,780
A better choice is a term used in geopolitics as well as econometrics: regime change.

12
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,910
It is helpful in this matter to start with two stylised facts.

13
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:26,600
The first is that in recent years, bond and equity prices have tended to move in opposite directions over the business cycle.

14
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:34,760
When recessions hit, bond prices tend to rise sharply (their yields fall) and equity prices usually crash.

15
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,219
When the economy recovers, bonds tend to fall in price and equity prices go up again.

16
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,640
You can think of this in terms of risk appetite.

17
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,239
Government bonds are safe assets.

18
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,640
People rush into them when they fear for the future.

19
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,380
Equities, by contrast, are risky assets, so people shun them in troubled times.

20
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:01,580
The second stylised fact concerns a secular relationship rather than a cyclical one.

21
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:09,050
Since the early 1980s bond and equity prices have moved in the same broad direction—upwards.

22
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,040
If you look at low-frequency data over a long period, the bond-equity correlation is positive.

23
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,599
This is best understood in terms of yields rather than prices.

24
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:28,390
For the past four decades, there has been a secular decline in government-bond yields, reflecting a secular decline in interest rates.

25
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:35,879
The earnings yield on equities has fallen, too, as have yields on other assets, such as corporate bonds and property.

26
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,480
This should not be a surprise.

27
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,289
Yields are a gauge of expected returns.

28
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:44,380
Bonds and equities compete for investors’ capital.

29
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,600
Over the long haul the prices and yields of each will respond to those of the other.

30
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,110
These two facts may seem at odds, but a third fact makes them consistent.

31
00:02:55,559 --> 00:03:04,110
In each business cycle, interest rates tend to rise as the economy gathers strength (so bonds and equities diverge over short periods).

32
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:12,990
But each business-cycle peak in interest rates is lower than the previous one (so bonds and equity prices converge over the long run).

33
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:17,829
That in turn is a response to the secular decline in inflation.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,900
Indeed, inflation is central to the bond-equity relationship.

35
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,610
It is here that things become trickier, and the notion of regime change matters.

36
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,920
Bonds promise fixed cash payments in the future.

37
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,250
Those cashflows are worth less when inflation unexpectedly rises.

38
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,550
By contrast, equities have generally outpaced inflation over the long haul.

39
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,250
But the relationship between inflation and equity prices is not stable.

40
00:03:46,790 --> 00:04:00,700
A study by Sushil Wadhwani, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee, in 2013 found that higher inflation generally helped to boost stockmarket returns in Britain in the two centuries before 1914.

41
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,820
But by the last half of the 20th century a negative relationship had emerged.

42
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,889
You might best explain this finding in terms of monetary regimes.

43
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:19,460
Under the pre-1914 gold standard, inflation was mean-reverting: if it was high one year, it would fall the next.

44
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:26,370
But in the era of fiat money, especially in the 1970s, the checks on inflation were less binding.

45
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,670
In the past few decades central banks were given inflation targets, and the monetary regime switched again.

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,070
Now, yet another regime change may be afoot.

47
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:43,760
Fiscal stimulus is back in favour, which has an unsettling 1970s feel to it.

48
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:55,540
Fiscal policy fell out of fashion because it was not well suited to fine-tuning aggregate demand; politicians are reluctant to cut spending or raise taxes when the economy threatens to overheat.

49
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:04,530
And the old-style central banker—reared in academia, aloof from politics, paranoid about inflation—is now almost extinct.

50
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,720
The new breed talks about climate change and inequality and is sanguine about inflation risks.

51
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,889
This feeds a general sense of lost policy discipline.

52
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,270
Sooner or later, warn the hawks, this will end in tears.

53
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:32,800
Many of the people who predict the return of 1970s-style inflation used to deride the old-school, bookish rate-setter, with his fancy econometrics and lack of market smarts.

54
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:39,029
It is no small irony that they now feel so nostalgic for the pointy-headed central banker.
