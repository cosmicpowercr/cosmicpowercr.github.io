00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:24,260
BRENDA GUTIéRREZ, a 50-year-old shellfish gatherer, knew she was a Chango for as long as she can remember.

2
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,319
When she was growing up in a fishing village in northern Chile, her parents always called her Changuita (little Chango girl).

3
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,030
Her schoolmates, alas, called her“smelly”and“dirty”because of her indigenous roots.

4
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,740
Such discrimination turned her into an activist.

5
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,690
She lobbied for the Chilean state to recognise her people, an indigenous group whose culture is supposedly extinct.

6
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,090
“We exist and are alive,”she says.

7
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:58,090
In October last year, the Changos won recognition.

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,670
And an election next month for a convention to change Chile’s old constitution could boost them further.

9
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:16,390
The Chango—a colonial-era term which has stuck—are descended from nomads who inhabited South America’s west coast over 10,000 years ago.

10
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:30,019
Despite their culture having supposedly vanished, 4,725 Chileans defined themselves as Chango in a 2017 census, in the“other”category.

11
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:39,120
Many still work as hardscrabble nautical types, as their ancestors did (they were known for sea-lion skin rafts).

12
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:50,050
Some still use ancient tools such as the chinguillo, a net fibre bag to carry fish, and the chope, an iron file to scrape molluscs off rocks.

13
00:01:51,080 --> 00:02:03,309
One reason why people mistakenly thought they no longer existed is that the Chango people, who are thought to have come from a number of different tribes in coastal areas of northern Chile, tended to assimilate.

14
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,180
(By, for example, abandoning their native languages for Spanish.

15
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:18,329
) And unlike other groups, such as the Diaguitas (recognised in 2006), most of them did not see any need to be officially acknowledged.

16
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:32,150
According to Luis Campos, an anthropologist, many were politicised only after a fishing law in 1991 and its amendments in the 2000s limited fishing to certain areas.

17
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,130
Chileans are growing more aware of their indigenous compatriots.

18
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,969
Over the past two decades more have appeared in official statistics.

19
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:51,609
Some 13% of Chileans are now recorded as indigenous, up from around 5% in the census of 2002.

20
00:02:52,870 --> 00:03:02,230
In October last year the Chango were added to the list of peoples entitled to benefits under the Indigenous Peoples Law of 1993.

21
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,920
This law offers scholarships and economic development grants.

22
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,290
It also provides a chance to reclaim ancestral land.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,870
More recognition is coming, too.

24
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:19,459
Elections for the body to draft a new constitution will take place on April 11th.

25
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,990
The constitutional convention will have 155 members.

26
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,270
Seventeen seats have been reserved for indigenous groups.

27
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:43,970
Their votes could be crucial to achieve the two-thirds majority required to approve each clause of the new constitution, thinks Antonia Rivas of the Centre for Intercultural and Indigenous Research.

28
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:53,770
For activists such as Ms Gutiérrez, who is standing as a potential candidate at the convention, such influence could transform Chile.

29
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,530
The country is still recovering from huge protests against inequality in late 2019.

30
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:12,190
The various indigenous groups (such as the Mapuche, who are 10% of indigenous people in the country) were not mentioned in Chile’s constitution, drawn up in 1980.

31
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,530
Now they will have a seat at the table to draft the new one.
