00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:26,570
WHEN IT comes to using artificial intelligence (AI), intelligence agencies have been at it longer than most.

2
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:44,610
In the cold war America’s National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) explored early AI to help transcribe and translate the enormous volumes of Soviet phone-intercepts they began hoovering up in the 1960s and 1970s.

3
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,730
Yet the technology was immature.

4
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:58,890
One former European intelligence officer says his service did not use automatic transcription or translation in Afghanistan in the 2000s, relying on native speakers instead.

5
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,170
Now the spooks are hoping to do better.

6
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:14,019
The trends that have made AI attractive for business in recent years—more data, better algorithms, and more processing power to make it all hum—are giving spy agencies big ideas, too.

7
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,760
On February 24th GCHQ published a paper on how AI might change its work.

8
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:30,770
“Machine-assisted fact-checking”could help spot faked images, check disinformation against trusted sources and identify social-media bots that spread it.

9
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:43,449
AI might block cyber-attacks by“analysing patterns of activity on networks and devices”, and fight organised crime by spotting suspicious chains of financial transactions.

10
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:48,419
Other, less well-resourced organisations have already shown what is possible.

11
00:01:49,240 --> 00:02:04,580
The Nuclear Threat Initiative, an American NGO, recently showed that applying machine learning to publicly available trade data could spot previously unknown companies and organisations suspected of involvement in the illicit trade in materials for nuclear weapons.

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,820
But spy agencies are not restricted to publicly available data.

13
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:18,890
Some hope that, aided by their ability to snoop on private information, such modest applications could pave the way to an AI-fuelled juggernaut.

14
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:38,930
“AI will revolutionise the practice of intelligence,”gushed a report published on March 1st by America’s National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a high-powered study group co-chaired by Eric Schmidt, a former executive chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and Bob Work, a former deputy defence secretary.

15
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,970
The report does not lack ambition.

16
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:59,150
It says that by 2030 America’s 17 or so spy agencies ought to have built a "federated architecture of continually learning analytic engines" capable of crunching everything from human intelligence to satellite imagery in order to to foresee looming threats.

17
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:10,659
The commission points approvingly to the Pentagon’s response to covid-19, which integrated dozens of data sets to identify covid-19 hotspots and manage demand for supplies.

18
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,810
Yet what is possible in public health is not always so easy in national security.

19
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,230
Western intelligence agencies must contend with laws governing how private data may be gathered and used.

20
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:38,350
In its paper, GCHQ says that it will be mindful of systemic bias, such as whether voice-recognition software is more effective with some groups than others, and transparent about margins of error and uncertainty in its algorithms.

21
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:45,870
American spies say, more vaguely, that they will respect“human dignity, rights, and freedoms”.

22
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,419
These differences may need to be ironed out.

23
00:03:50,250 --> 00:04:10,240
One suggestion made by a recent task-force of former American spooks in a report published by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington was that the“Five Eyes”intelligence alliance—America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand—create a shared cloud server on which to store data.

24
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,880
In any case, the constraints facing AI in intelligence are as much practical as ethical.

25
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:25,570
Machine learning is good at spotting patterns—such as distinctive patterns of mobile-phone use—but poor at predicting individual behaviour.

26
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:30,039
That is especially true when data are scarce, as in counter-terrorism.

27
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,020
Predictive-policing models can crunch data from thousands of burglaries each year.

28
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,150
Terrorist attacks are much rarer, and therefore harder to learn from.

29
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:47,640
That rarity creates another problem, familiar to medics pondering mass-screening programmes for rare diseases.

30
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,030
Any predictive model will generate false positives, in which innocent people are flagged for investigation.

31
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,990
Careful design can drive the false-positive rate down.

32
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,810
And those data that do exist may not be suitable.

33
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:24,580
Data from drone cameras, reconnaissance satellite and intercepted phone calls, for instance, are not currently formatted or labelled in ways that are useful for machine learning.

34
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:37,820
Fixing that is a“tedious, time-consuming, and still primarily human task exacerbated by differing labelling standards across and even within agencies”, notes the CSIS report.

35
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,169
That may not be quite the sort of work that would-be spies signed up for.
