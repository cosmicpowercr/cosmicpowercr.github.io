00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:22,510
THE WEEK in financial markets got off to a breezy start, belying the turmoil of the previous week.

2
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:32,289
By the time the New York market closed on March 1st, the S&P 500 index of leading shares had risen by a carefree 2,5% on the day.

3
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,159
Europe’s stockmarkets had already followed Asia’s lead in closing sharply up.

4
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:47,209
The mood in Asia was helped by Australia’s central bank, which acted to calm bond-market nerves by announcing it would intervene to buy long-dated government paper.

5
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:54,869
Yields on ten-year Aussie bonds, which had risen quickly since New Year’s Day, fell by some 0,25 percentage points.

6
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,210
Stockmarkets gave up Monday’s gains on Tuesday and Wednesday.

7
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:08,460
But conditions in America’s government-bond market were somewhat calmer, in stark contrast to the week before, when anxiety about inflation took hold.

8
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:16,010
The steady fall in bond prices since the start of the year had suddenly quickened to a pace that threatened a destabilising rout.

9
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:24,980
During February 25th the benchmark ten-year Treasury yield spiked above 1,6% (bond yields move inversely to prices).

10
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,530
That is still low by historical standards, but a lot higher than it started the day, or indeed the year.

11
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:38,020
This prompted a big one-day fall in the S&P 500 and a bigger fall in the tech-heavy NASDAQ.

12
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,690
Almost as suddenly, the worst fears about inflation have receded again—but perhaps not for long.

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,829
Much of what has happened is to be expected.

14
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,030
Bond prices ought to fall as the economy recovers.

15
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:59,580
The ten-year Treasury is the benchmark bond and is thus a barometer of risk appetite in markets and of economic confidence more broadly.

16
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,020
And it is global benchmark.

17
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:10,120
The sharp rise in Treasury yields from the start of the year until February 25th was matched by yields on bonds in other places (see chart 1).

18
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:17,260
Bond prices move in the opposite direction to confidence; bond yields go in the same direction as confidence.

19
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,730
When the outlook for the economy is bleak, as it was in March last year, yields fall sharply as investors rush to the safety of bonds.

20
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,820
As the outlook brightens, bond prices start to fall and yields start to rise again.

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,379
Bond prices are thus countercyclical most of the time.

22
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,410
Mild inflation is not to be feared.

23
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:55,080
Indeed it is in part changes in the market’s expectations of inflation that drive bond yields down in recessions and up in recoveries.

24
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,749
But hopes for a reflation of the economy can quickly spill over into fear of higher inflation.

25
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,180
The case for this seems stronger than it has for many years.

26
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,870
The American economy is recovering quickly.

27
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,380
Fiscal transfers have left households with lots of extra savings.

28
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,310
Lockdowns have given rise to pent-up demand.

29
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Already there is plenty of fuel for a spending spree when the economy reopens in earnest.

30
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,100
And more is on the way.

31
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,890
President Biden’s $1,9trn stimulus package is likely to become law this month.

32
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:33,830
A jump in the annual inflation rate seems assured in the coming months, if only because prices were depressed a year ago.

33
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,900
Perhaps, then, the strength of consumer spending, as people start to move around more freely, might further push it up.

34
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,379
These latent anxieties form the backdrop to the recent turmoil.

35
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,420
Three factors in particular seemed to be at work.

36
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:59,210
First, the market for future short-term rates started to price in interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve by early 2023, sooner than the Fed had indicated thus far.

37
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:09,470
You can call this the inflation-fear element: if the economy seemingly has this much momentum behind it, can the Fed really hold off from raising rates for very long?

38
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,960
And if it tightens sooner, might the peak in interest rates be higher?

39
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:26,589
That would be a big concern for America’s stockmarkets, where high prices relative to future earnings are largely justified by the expectation that interest rates will remain very low for a long time.

40
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:37,180
Second, just as the market was having a rethink about Fed policy, the Treasury held auctions for two-year, five-year and seven-year bond issues on February 25th.

41
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,839
These are maturities that are sensitive to shifts in expectations about Fed policy in 2023-24.

42
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,550
Indeed the one-day rise in the five-year-bond yield was notable (see chart 2).

43
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,700
The auctions went poorly.

44
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,609
The seven-year bond had the lowest bid-to-cover ratio (a gauge of excess demand) for an issue of its kind for more than a decade.

45
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:02,569
This further spooked the market about the underlying demand for bonds.

46
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,310
Third, the volatility in the bond market seems to have caused liquidity to dry up.

47
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,530
So for a given volume of selling, prices fell further than they otherwise might have.

48
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,800
Each of these three factors reinforced the other—hence the drama.

49
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,059
Given the anxieties about inflation, you may wonder why the bond market recovered its poise.

50
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:30,040
There are probably limits to how far an inflation scare can run this early in the economic recovery.

51
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:39,420
The message from the Fed’s rate-setters has generally been that they are not even thinking about thinking about raising rates or cutting back on bond purchases.

52
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,480
In a speech on March 2nd Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, stuck to that script.

53
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:54,260
“Today the economy remains far from our goals in terms of both employment and inflation, and it will take some time to achieve substantial further progress,”she said.

54
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:03,920
The intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia is a reminder that central banks have the firepower to cap bond yields, if they are determined to do so.

55
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,350
And some private-sector investors will see value in Treasuries at these yields.

56
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,770
Foreign buyers from Europe and Japan, for instance, where yields are lower, may find them attractive.

57
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,080
All this has restored a measure of calm to the bond market.

58
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,840
Ten-year Treasury yields are inching upwards again, having fallen back to 1,4%.

59
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,169
The equity market is choppy, but that might be expected after such a long run-up in prices.

60
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:36,710
You could put the events of last week down to“technical issues”, the catch-all explanation for many a financial-market scare.

61
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,420
But that would be a little too sanguine.

62
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:46,210
Episodes in which trading liquidity suddenly dries up seem to be becoming more frequent in the Treasury market.

63
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,649
These sorts of scares will recur.

64
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,700
Inflation is the bogeyman of financial markets.

65
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,180
A whole constellation of expensive assets depends on its quiescence.

66
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,960
No one can yet be confident that it will stay subdued.

67
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,320
Further bouts of bond-market jitters are likely before the year is out.
