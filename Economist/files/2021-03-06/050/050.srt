00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,500
ON FEBRUARY 14th 1962, the American people fell in love with the White House.

2
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,879
Jackie Kennedy, with some help from CBS News, guided 56m of them through her renovations.

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:40,440
The tour made such good television that the first lady won an Emmy; and, as Mrs Kennedy intended, the smartened-up White House came to embody the grandeur of American democracy.

4
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:50,969
Carrie Symonds, Boris Johnson’s fiancee, may have a harder time getting the British public to buy into her plan for sprucing up the prime ministerial quarters in Downing Street.

5
00:00:51,420 --> 00:01:04,110
According to a profile in Tatler magazine, she wants to get rid of the“John Lewis furniture nightmare”—a dangerous reference to the department store that is a mecca to the British middle classes—and replace it with something more upmarket.

6
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:10,000
The Daily Mail reports that the plan is to pay for the refurbishment through a privately funded charity.

7
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:12,960
The plan would offer a solution to a particular problem.

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:32,080
Number 10 is a venue for hosting world leaders but prime ministers get only £30,000 a year from the public purse for redecorations, and a parliamentary expenses scandal over claims for duck-houses and moat-cleaning 12 years ago means that Britons are hawk-eyed when it comes to their politicians’ expenses.

9
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:41,629
Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, was derided this week when it emerged she had the audacity to claim expenses for Apple AirPods and an iPad.

10
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:52,280
Britons would rather their prime ministers lived in a hovel and their MPs communicate by carrier pigeon than pay for such extravagances as curtains and computers from the public purse.

11
00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:07,230
An alternative would be for Mr Johnson to follow the example of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, who reportedly paid for $1,5m and $1,75m of refurbishments respectively out of their own pockets.

12
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,060
That is unlikely to happen.

13
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:19,789
Mr Johnson’s salary, at £160,000, is modest for a world leader, and with a couple of divorces behind him and at least six children, he has a lot of mouths to feed.

14
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:27,470
In the year before he took the current job he earned £829,255, mostly from writing.

15
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:39,289
He had a contract for a book on Shakespeare, which was due to be published last April, four years late; but even the famously productive prime minister has presumably had little time recently to devote to the Bard.

16
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:49,890
Mr Johnson’s publishers are evidently taking a realistic view of his attitude to deadlines, for Amazon now gives its publication date as 2035.
