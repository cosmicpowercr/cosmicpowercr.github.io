00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,120
O PERCH OFFERS an insight into the health of a society like a dentist’s stool.

2
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:41,060
As a young practitioner in Paisley, an old weaving town outside Glasgow once famed for its teardrop-patterned scarves, Anas Sarwar would from time to time be called upon to perform“full clearances”on patients in their late teens, and fit them with dentures.

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:51,270
The problem was methadone, a heroin substitute prescribed to addicts which is both acidic and sticky“and would pretty much fry the dentition”.

4
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:58,630
The regional health board has the highest drug death rate in Scotland, which in turn has the highest in Europe.

5
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:07,220
Alleviating such misery was the historic mission of the Labour Party in Scotland, which Mr Sarwar was elected to lead on February 27th.

6
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,990
Towns like Paisley were its firmest strongholds, reliably returning Labour MPs since the war.

7
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:19,000
At its zenith 20 years ago it ran Britain.

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,770
Scots filled the Cabinet, in the form of Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, John Reid and Alistair Darling, and the ranks of advisers.

9
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,250
In 1999, the party created Scotland’s devolved government, and then ran it.

10
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,830
It was downhill from there.

11
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,260
In 2007, the Scottish National Party took power in Edinburgh.

12
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:49,140
In the 2015 general election, Labour was swept away in a nationalist surge, losing 40 of its 41 Westminster seats.

13
00:01:49,660 --> 00:02:01,160
Among them was Mr Sarwar’s in Glasgow Central, a seat previously held for 13 years by his father Mohammad (who now serves as Governor of Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province).

14
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,000
The party is now third in the Scottish Parliament, behind the Tories.

15
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:15,870
The biggest problem for Mr Sarwar, Labour’s seventh full-time leader in Scotland since 2007, is the constitutional cleavage.

16
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:23,949
The independence referendum of 2014, in which Labour campaigned to keep the United Kingdom together, was a centrifuge.

17
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:30,240
The nationalist vote has consolidated behind the SNP, and unionists behind Tories.

18
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,229
Labour bled at both ends, just as the party split over Brexit in the rest of Britain.

19
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:44,110
A senior Tory compares Mr Sarwar favourably to Ruth Davidson, who revived the Scottish Conservatives.

20
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:56,769
Like Sir Keir Starmer’s election to Labour’s leadership last year, it is a tack to the centre following the lacklustre tenure of Richard Leonard, who fired and then rehired Mr Sarwar to the shadow cabinet.

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,450
“We didn’t join the Labour Party to be a protest movement,”says Mr Sarwar.

22
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,960
An exodus of disgruntled Corbynistas helped him win.

23
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,740
Mr Sarwar’s first big test comes in the elections to the Scottish Parliament in May.

24
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:19,099
Scottish voters say the constitution is the most important factor in determining their vote, before covid-19.

25
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:35,119
“They are now polarised in their party choice between independents versus non-independents in a way they’ve not previously been to anything like the same extent in Scottish politics,”says John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde.

26
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,650
That’s a problem for a party for whom“politics is about left versus right.”

27
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:48,220
Mr Sarwar, who as a dentist enjoyed soothing fearful patients, seeks a détente.

28
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:55,550
“For ten years, we have had politicians who have presented binary choices to the public, and forced them to pick a side,”he says.

29
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:03,689
The Scottish Parliament’s focus should be on the country’s recovery from covid-19, rather than a struggle to split from London.

30
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:14,740
Labour is toying with ideas to revive devolution, which nationalists think inadequate and Tories regard as a failed strategy for quenching separatism.

31
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,820
Mr Sarwar favours more powers for local authorities.

32
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:33,440
Gordon Brown has called for Scotland to take a greater share of the powers previously wielded by Brussels, an overhauled House of Lords, and a new constitutional text declaring the“mission”of the UK’s four nations.

33
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,610
Reforms must be bold, for Scots have little appetite for tinkering.

34
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:51,340
In a three-way referendum, most would favour either independence or no change, while fewer than one in five would settle for more financial powers for Edinburgh, according to Panelbase, a pollster.

35
00:04:52,640 --> 00:05:01,170
The party brand isn’t wrecked and can be saved, for Scottish Labour is the preferred second-choice of both Conservatives and nationalists.

36
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,650
Whether Mr Sarwar succeeds may well determine the future of Britain.

37
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:09,700
The party’s weakness produces a brutal feedback loop.

38
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:18,420
If Scottish Labour cannot recover because of constitutional polarisation, it will be near-impossible for the Labour Party to win a majority in Britain.

39
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:29,090
The Conservatives will continue to spook English voters with the prospect of a rickety Labour-SNP coalition, cementing their dominance south of the border.

40
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:36,510
(In 2019, they ran ads featuring a tiny Jeremy Corbyn in Ms Sturgeon’s top pocket.

41
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:45,370
) The SNP can continue to tell left-leaning Scots that the only alternative to perpetual Tory rule is independence.

42
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,850
Conservatives know that the stalemate which has profited them handsomely is eroding the union.

43
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:56,600
For it to survive, they must lose, now and again.
