1
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:27,530
BRITAIN HAD a particularly bad bout of covid-19 and took an especially large economic hit as a result.

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:41,270
In response the government provided more fiscal stimulus than almost any other in the world, paying millions of people’s wages and bailing out businesses to the tune of 16% of GDP.

3
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:54,090
As Britain slowly lifts its lockdown the conversation has turned to balancing the books, and ahead of the budget on March 3rd the Treasury briefed that fiscal austerity was in store.

4
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,970
Yet Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, will wait to turn the screws.

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,760
He delivered a surprisingly generous budget, and has postponed tax rises.

6
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,160
Like a fiscal St Augustine, he wants continence—but not yet.

7
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:16,580
The budget represents the synthesis of two opposing forces.

8
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:34,420
On the one hand Mr Sunak wants to placate a range of hawkish constituencies, such as Thatcherite backbench Tory MPs who would rather the government keep taxes low and bond traders who in recent weeks have sold their investments in sovereign debt.

9
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:52,740
On the other hand he is rightly concerned not to repeat the mistake of his predecessor-but-two: after the financial crisis in 2007-09 George Osborne cut spending and raised taxes too soon, thereby delaying the recovery.

10
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,579
Policies in this budget are designed to help Britain out of its deep economic hole (see article).

11
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:10,220
The extension of the furlough scheme from April to September will put money in people’s pockets, helping power a recovery in household spending.

12
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:25,150
A highly unusual proposal to allow firms to write off 130% of investment expenses against their tax bills is designed to supercharge Britain’s perennially low rate of business investment.

13
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,460
At the same time, the budget has blind spots.

14
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:42,439
Extending the furlough is better than nothing, but it would have been wiser to focus resources on boosting working-age welfare, currently at its least generous level ever.

15
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:52,410
This would have helped workers move from dying sectors to up-and-coming ones without seeing a sharp drop in their take-home income.

16
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:01,230
And a government that likes to trumpet its green credentials should not be buying off voters by freezing taxes on fuel.

17
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,590
A bigger difficulty is that there is no credible strategy for righting the fiscal ship.

18
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:16,039
True, Mr Sunak promised to raise corporation tax in 2023 from 19% to 25%.

19
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,740
Politically that is astute.

20
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:35,519
It puts the opposition Labour Party into a tricky position, forcing it to decide whether it wants to support the rise (and thus implicitly back austerity) or oppose it (and thus appear to be taking the side of Britain’s corporate fat cats).

21
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,270
In economic terms, however, Mr Sunak is being evasive.

22
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,990
The yield from even large rises in corporation tax is low.

23
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:56,580
Moreover, will he actually impose such a tax rise just when the 130% investment write-off ends and when an election is likely to be just around the corner?

24
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:10,290
It is more probable that the chancellor hopes the coming investment boom is so large that he can cancel most of the tax increase and that he will be able to pass a smaller rise as, in effect, a“cut”.

25
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,880
At some point, however, politics will catch up with him.

26
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:29,150
That is in part because of Britain’s rapidly ageing population, and in part because the government has bizarrely made no provision whatsoever for virus-related costs beyond next year.

27
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,690
Britain is on an inexorable trend towards higher budget deficits.

28
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,670
It is hard to find much waste in the public sector, which limits the scope to cut spending.

29
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:44,590
The chancellor will have to fall back on higher taxes.

30
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:52,210
He will have to consider slaying sacred Tory cows, including a pledge not to increase income tax.

31
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,890
He should consider reform of property and value-added taxes.

32
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:06,140
Hawkish rhetoric is all very well, but eventually Mr Sunak will have to follow St Augustine onto the path of fiscal virtue.
