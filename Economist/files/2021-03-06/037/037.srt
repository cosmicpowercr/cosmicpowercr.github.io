00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:26,650
WHEN GAY Nigerians took to the streets to join massive protests against police brutality last year, it was not just the police who attacked them.

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:34,829
Fellow protesters also hurled insults at them, ripped up their rainbow flags and tore placards from their hands.

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,150
“I felt like a lot of people just wanted me dead,”says Matthew Blaise, a 21-year-old student.

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:51,320
In many parts of the world the young are far more tolerant than their elders of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:02,920
But with a few exceptions, such as in Botswana, which decriminalised homosexuality in 2019, young Africans seem to be almost as homophobic as their grandparents.

6
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:18,440
A survey released last year by Afrobarometer, a pollster, found that only 21% of Africans aged 18-25 would not mind having a gay neighbour, compared with 17% of those aged 66 or older.

7
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:33,070
That makes Africa different from places like Japan, where 92% of those aged 18-29 think homosexuality should be accepted by society, compared with just 56% of those above the age of 50.

8
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:42,740
The homophobia of young Africans is especially worrying, given how numerous they are: half the continent’s population is under the age of 20.

9
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,210
And it contrasts starkly with their tolerance in other areas.

10
00:01:48,309 --> 00:02:06,619
In an African Youth Survey last year, conducted in 14 countries and funded by a South African foundation, 83% of young Africans said that more should be done to protect the rights of ethnic minorities, while 64% agreed that“sexual harassment is a problem in my country”.

11
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:15,360
Yet 69% disagreed with the statement:“My country should do more to protect the rights of LGBTQ people.”

12
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,950
(The Q stands for“queer or questioning”.

13
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,459
) This is not because robust protections for gay rights are already in place.

14
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:32,680
On the contrary, at least 32 African countries still criminalise gay sex, and openly gay people are often abused, beaten up or worse.

15
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:40,270
Only one country, South Africa, has genuinely gay-friendly laws (eg, it allows same-sex marriage).

16
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:48,100
Even there, outside urban liberal enclaves gay people are at serious risk of being attacked or even murdered.

17
00:02:49,120 --> 00:03:00,870
Savn Daniel, a Nigerian human-rights activist, wrote on Twitter that people trying to support gay rights as part of a broader struggle against police brutality“should be arrested and prosecuted”.

18
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,350
“We’re not wasting lives for such unlawful nonsense!”he wrote.

19
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:15,130
Human rights, he argues, are not universal but“context-specific”and should not be used to upend Africa’s conservative moral values.

20
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:24,660
“They look progressive but they are very, very homophobic,”says Mr Blaise of many of the Nigerians who protest against police brutality.

21
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,520
“I see them as oppressors.”

22
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:40,130
Across the continent in Sudan a gay artist, Ahmed Umar, who took part in the revolution that toppled President Omar al-Bashir in 2019, has faced death threats because of his sexuality.

23
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,789
“What has this young generation learned from this experience of being under a dictatorship?”

24
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,790
he asks.

25
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,290
“How can they not see that what they are practising is exactly what they had practised on them?”

26
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:55,860
Much homophobia is religiously inspired.

27
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,970
After the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest proportion of religious people in the world.

28
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:09,210
It is the only region where the young are just as religious as their parents, according to the Pew Research Centre, a pollster.

29
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:21,560
Conservative strains of Christianity and Islam predominate, whose adherents deem homosexual acts sinful, notes Ayo Sogunro of the Centre for Human Rights in South Africa.

30
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:34,560
Studies suggest that religion in Africa exerts more sway over how people view same-sex relationships than their level of education, whether they live in cities or the countryside, or whether they are on the internet.

31
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,740
Opportunistic politicians often denounce homosexuality as un-African—a depraved Western import.

32
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:53,990
In Uganda’s recent election President Yoweri Museveni tried to smear his opponent, Bobi Wine, by saying“he gets quite a lot of encouragement from foreigners and homosexuals.”

33
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,770
Yet during the campaign gay Ugandans were abused not only by Mr Museveni’s supporters but by Mr Wine’s as well.

34
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,920
Despite the risks, young gay Africans are gaining the courage to stand up for themselves.

35
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:17,519
“Queer folk are being assertive right now,”says Basiru Alumbugu of the African Queer Youth Initiative, a network of activists across the continent.

36
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,209
The backlash is a sign that gay Africans are more visible than before.

37
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,580
A generation ago, they could not organise online, and hardly any would have dared to take to the streets.

38
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,889
“We could never have protested 20 years ago,”says Vincent Desmond, a gay Nigerian journalist.

39
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,210
In other regions, as more gay people came out, their neighbours eventually learned to see them as normal.

40
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,720
Activists hope that will happen in Africa, too.

41
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,090
But it takes courage to lead the way.
