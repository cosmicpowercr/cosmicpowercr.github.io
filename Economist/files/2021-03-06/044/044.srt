00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:23,800
ON MARCH 1ST Russian news announced that Alexei Navalny was moving to a new prison, Penal Colony No.

2
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,590
2, notorious for psychological torture.

3
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,059
Two days later his lawyers found him in a different, and less ghastly, jail.

4
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,130
Russia’s justice system likes to keep people guessing.

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:46,040
The Kremlin says Mr Navalny, Russia’s main opposition leader, is a common criminal, as well as being a Western agent.

6
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,110
Its propagandists tout his (plainly bogus) fraud conviction.

7
00:00:51,700 --> 00:01:01,810
Their struggle to convict him in the court of public opinion has received a boost from an unlikely source: Amnesty International, a global human-rights group.

8
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:13,300
On February 23rd Amnesty said it had decided to stop calling Mr Navalny a“prisoner of conscience”, a term first popularised by Amnesty itself.

9
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:20,360
The reason given was that he had made some xenophobic comments nearly 15 years ago.

10
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,129
Amnesty had not planned to publicise this decision, but an internal memo had leaked.

11
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,490
Kremlin megaphones went wild.

12
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:38,989
Day after day they quoted Amnesty’s verdict that Mr Navalny’s comments constituted“advocacy of hatred”.

13
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:51,750
“I very much understand Amnesty International which talks about hatred from Navalny’s side,”crowed Dmitry Kiselev, Mr Putin’s operatic propagandist-in-chief.

14
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,150
The head of RT, a state broadcaster, called Mr Navalny a Nazi.

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,160
This propaganda coup was made easier by a shift in philosophy at Amnesty.

16
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:18,960
In 1961 Peter Benenson, the group’s founder, defined a“prisoner of conscience”as anyone who is locked up for expressing an opinion“which does not advocate or condone personal violence”.

17
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,119
For decades, this definition worked well.

18
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,610
Amnesty’s campaigns helped bring about the release of legions of dissidents, including many in the old Soviet Union.

19
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:36,090
But a new generation of activists decided that it was not enough to eschew violence.

20
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:45,749
Since 1995, to merit the label“prisoner of conscience”, a dissident must also not have used hateful language.

21
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:53,960
Two videos Mr Navalny made, in 2007 and 2011, failed that test.

22
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,430
At the time he was trying to build a broad coalition of liberals and nationalists to oppose Mr Putin.

23
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:11,020
To this end, he sought to persuade patriotic voters not to back violent ultra-nationalists, who were then on the rise.

24
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:18,659
In one video he condemned physical attacks on illegal immigrants, and said Russia should deport them instead.

25
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,980
In another, he referred to Islamist militants as“cockroaches”.

26
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:35,640
Mr Navalny has long ago publicly expressed regret for using disparaging language about other ethnic groups, but has not specifically disavowed the videos.

27
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:41,790
His activism now consists largely of pointing out how corrupt the Putin regime is.

28
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,000
This rattles the Kremlin, which is why it tried to assassinate him last year.

29
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:57,710
It is also why its propagandists worked so hard, after Amnesty named Mr Navalny a prisoner of conscience in January, to persuade the group that he isn’t.

30
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,420
Amnesty was flooded by almost identical complaints about Mr Navalny from“concerned citizens”.

31
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:17,320
Many cited a Twitter thread by Katya Kazbek, a freelancer for RT, highlighting the old videos and calling Mr Navalny“an avowed racist”.

32
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:26,380
The complainants urged Amnesty to abide by its own rules and strike Mr Navalny off its list of prisoners of conscience.

33
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:33,089
It did—and, by doing so, raised questions about those rules.

34
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:40,820
The old definition of a prisoner of conscience was clear: a dissident who neither commits nor advocates violence.

35
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,690
The new one is fuzzy.

36
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:49,860
What counts as“hate speech”changes rapidly, and varies from place to place and listener to listener.

37
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:59,200
If Amnesty disqualifies anyone who has ever said anything that is currently deemed hateful, it hands despots a powerful tool.

38
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:06,420
Dig up the worst thing a dissident has ever said, and watch a Western human-rights group tie itself in knots.

39
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:16,499
Amnesty says it still considers Mr Navalny a political prisoner, even if he is not a prisoner of conscience, and calls for his release.

40
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
Boris Akunin, a novelist, wrote to Amnesty:“Instead of protecting a man who was first almost killed and then unjustly imprisoned by a dictatorship you struck him a further blow.

41
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:39,140
You closed the doors of his cell even tighter, making it harder for us all to fight for the man’s freedom.

42
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,990
By adhering to the letter of your protocol you failed the spirit of your mission.”
