00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:25,070
THINGS ARE moving quickly in Qaraqosh, a sleepy Christian town just outside Mosul in northern Iraq.

2
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,689
Pope Francis arrives on March 7th, four years after Islamic State (IS) was chased out.

3
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:39,130
So local priests have been hurriedly cleaning up al-Tahira, their cathedral and one of Iraq’s largest churches.

4
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:46,720
They have refurbished its burnt interior and repaired most of the masonry that the jihadists used for target practice.

5
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:56,420
When your correspondent visited, five days before the pope, smashed chandeliers and a golden crucifix torn down by IS still littered the forecourt.

6
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:06,240
Father Ammar Yako, the priest overseeing the project, says he has received no support from the Iraqi government; the funding has come from Catholic groups in the West.

7
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:09,780
He says he will finish just in time for the Holy Father.

8
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:17,780
Pope Francis is the first-ever pontiff to visit Iraq, where over 95% of the population is thought to be Muslim.

9
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:24,549
He arrives at a difficult time for its Christians, whose forebears have been in the country since the first century.

10
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,430
Churches are being rebuilt, but there are fewer believers to fill the pews.

11
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,270
Around 1,2m Christians lived in Iraq in 2003.

12
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:42,660
War and misery have pushed that number down to around 250,000, or less than 1% of the population (see chart).

13
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,870
Many of those who left will never come back.

14
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:51,640
But Iraq’s leaders hope that Christians displaced within the country will soon feel safe enough to go home.

15
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,860
President Barham Salih says the pope’s visit will help Iraq to“heal”.

16
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,589
The trouble for Christians began after the removal of Saddam Hussein, Iraq’s dictator, in 2003.

17
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,870
He had largely protected the group—even making a Christian, Tariq Aziz, his deputy prime minister.

18
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,220
But some Muslims view Christianity, despite its long history in the region, as a Western import.

19
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:26,470
Anti-Christian violence increased during the American occupation and turned into an existential threat when IS captured swathes of the country in 2014.

20
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,250
The jihadists told Christians that they could leave, convert to Islam or be killed.

21
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:42,290
In August that year, around 100,000 of them fled from the Nineveh Plains, the heartland of Iraqi Christianity, which IS conquered.

22
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:49,600
Some went to Baghdad or to Erbil, capital of the autonomous Kurdish region, but many left the country.

23
00:02:50,309 --> 00:03:04,550
An enduring source of resentment towards Christians in Iraq comes from the notion that they can easily claim asylum in the West, says Pascale Warda of the Hammurabi Human Rights Organisation, an NGO in Baghdad.

24
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:20,880
Aid to Church in Need, a Catholic charity based in Germany, estimates that the war against IS destroyed or damaged 14,936 homes and 363 church properties in the Nineveh Plains.

25
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:27,220
Around 57% of the homes and 11% of the church properties had been repaired by January.

26
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,410
Christians have trickled back.

27
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,410
But many sold their homes to Muslim families.

28
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,690
Others stay away because of a lack of security and jobs.

29
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:47,200
Reconstruction has happened separately from efforts to stabilise the region, says Reine Hanna of the Assyrian Policy Institute, a think-tank in Washington.

30
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:56,070
It reckons that across the Nineveh Plains, 53% of Assyrians, a predominantly Christian ethnic minority, have returned to their villages.

31
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,210
But in some areas that number is less than 10%.

32
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,370
“When people don’t feel safe, it doesn’t matter if they have reconstructed churches or houses,”says Ms Hanna.

33
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,189
The calculations of Christian families often depend on which group controls their home town.

34
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,220
At least six groups claim authority in different parts of the Nineveh Plains.

35
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:28,080
They include Iranian-backed and predominantly Shia militias (known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces), Kurdish forces (known as the Peshmerga) and the Iraqi government.

36
00:04:28,549 --> 00:04:36,060
In many places portraits of Qassem Suleimani, the late commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, are common.

37
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,790
But in towns controlled by the Nineveh Plain Protection Units, a Christian militia, Pope Francis smiles down from billboards.

38
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,670
Unsurprisingly, these towns have higher rates of return.

39
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,790
The Iraqi government has made at least some effort to reach out to Christians.

40
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,920
It declared Christmas an official holiday last year.

41
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,330
But many Christians say it treats them as second-class citizens.

42
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,000
They have a tougher time getting government jobs than Muslims.

43
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,170
The constitution dating from 2005 is based on Islam.

44
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,040
Marriages between Muslims and Christians are frowned upon.

45
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:19,589
Children born of mixed parentage are automatically classed as Muslim, even if the child is a product of rape.

46
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,130
In Baghdad, the capital, Christian businesses are often attacked, says Ms Warda.

47
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,120
Christian leaders were vocal supporters of big anti-government protests in 2019.

48
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,720
Iraqi Kurdistan, in the north-east, is more hospitable to Christians.

49
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:48,980
The Kurdish national project is based on ethnicity, not religion, and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has more provisions for religious pluralism than the Iraqi government has.

50
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:58,539
But the KRG does not always adhere to its own laws, says Ms Hanna, and ethnic tensions can be as febrile as religious ones.

51
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:03,980
Under Kurdish rule“you can be Christian, but you can’t be Assyrian,”she says.

52
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:14,260
Assyrians and Yazidis, another religious minority, felt abandoned when the Peshmerga withdrew from the Nineveh Plains in 2014, leaving the area to IS.

53
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,970
Some of that distrust still lingers.

54
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,610
Western aid groups have singled out Iraq’s Christians (and Yazidis).

55
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:37,960
USAID, America’s development agency, committed $27,5m (or 2,5% of its total development spending in Iraq) to help people returning to the Nineveh Plains in 2018 and 2019.

56
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,780
It was the only district to receive a dedicated stream of funding for resettlement from America.

57
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:55,720
USAID also renegotiated the terms of a $75m contribution to the UN in 2018 that was slated for a stabilisation project in Iraq.

58
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:02,790
The agency made sure that $55m would be spent supporting religious minorities in the Nineveh Plains.

59
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:10,639
When Donald Trump was America’s president, USAID was reportedly pressed to direct more support towards Christians.

60
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:15,330
Most Western countries do not want to be seen favouring one religion over another.

61
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,910
But some do not mind.

62
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:23,039
In 2017 Hungary launched“Hungary Helps”, a project aimed at Christians around the world.

63
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:38,160
Tristan Azbej, the Hungarian minister for the aid of persecuted Christians, said in 2018 that the programme’s“flagship project”was the reconstruction of Tesqopa, a predominantly Assyrian town in the Nineveh Plains.

64
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:44,729
For Christians, as for so many Iraqis, painful memories of fleeing their homes are still fresh.

65
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:50,880
Tempting them away from stable and relatively prosperous places such as Erbil will be difficult.

66
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,050
Convincing them to forgo Western visas will be tougher still.

67
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:04,600
Some Iraqis think the pope’s visit will raise awareness of Christianity’s long history in the country and, perhaps, lead to greater understanding between faiths.

68
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,930
But Father Yako thinks it will take a bigger effort.

69
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:14,010
“Other communities, especially Muslims, need to do more to make us feel comfortable,”he says.
