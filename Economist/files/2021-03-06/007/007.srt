1
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,880
JOE BIDEN has made no secret of his frustration with Saudi Arabia.

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,220
A“pariah”with“very little social redeeming value”, he called its government in 2019.

3
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:31,510
One of his first acts as president was to end American support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.

4
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:40,860
Last week he released an intelligence report that blamed the kingdom’s crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, for the murder of a journalist in 2018.

5
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,230
But at that point Mr Biden’s ideals collided with America’s national interest.

6
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,520
The prince may be a brute, but he is also in charge of an important American ally.

7
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,960
In the end Mr Biden decided that the cost of punishing him would have been too high.

8
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,220
This is all part of a larger cost-benefit analysis taking place in the White House.

9
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:06,590
Mr Biden has signalled that he wants to make the Middle East less of a priority.

10
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,689
He has good reason to pull back.

11
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:15,750
America has thousands of soldiers spread across Arab countries, yet its interventions have produced dismal results.

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,590
Many Americans argue that their country should instead focus on countering China’s growing global influence.

13
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:30,950
The question facing the Biden administration is how to lighten America’s burden in the Middle East while still protecting its vital interests there.

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,250
That will not be easy.

15
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,880
It helps that those interests are not what they were.

16
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,919
For decades America focused on the flow of Gulf oil and the survival of Israel.

17
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:46,640
Last year America was a net exporter of both oil and natural gas.

18
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:53,130
And Israel, the best-armed country in the region, now has formal ties with many of its Arab neighbours.

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,000
Yet vital interests remain.

20
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,960
Terrorist groups that find havens in Iraq, Syria or Yemen may end up striking the West.

21
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:14,760
If the government in Iran seeks a bomb it risks setting off an arms race that would blow apart the global non-proliferation regime and permanently put the Middle East on a nuclear knife-edge.

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,040
In the past America has sought to impose magical solutions.

23
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:23,180
George W Bush attempted to decree a democracy in Iraq.

24
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:28,990
Donald Trump wielded sanctions to force capitulation or a change in regime in Iran.

25
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:36,400
As these approaches failed, American policy swung between interest and apathy, and war and retreat.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,790
Mr Biden should instead try to bring stability by getting the region to take responsibility for itself and discouraging leaders from being so dependent on armed force.

27
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,520
America’s big arms sales to the region’s despots are a source of trouble.

28
00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:00,580
And they do little to help the region’s people, who suffer from poor government and abusive regimes, which in turn foster extremism.

29
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:09,500
RAND, a think-tank, recently noted that America spends roughly as much on Egypt’s armed forces as it does on aid to the entire region.

30
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:14,689
Mr Biden should cancel the blank cheque for mischief-making and repression.

31
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,790
The second leg to this strategy is to enhance the Middle East’s capacity for diplomacy.

32
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:33,020
The deals known as the Abraham Accords, which the Trump administration helped broker between Israel and several Arab states, are a tentative start towards upgrading the region’s diplomatic machinery.

33
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:36,040
Mr Biden should encourage more such talking.

34
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:44,330
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were shocked when Mr Trump failed to come to their defence after attacks by Iran and its proxies.

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,420
Iran is suffering under American sanctions.

36
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:54,279
Their anxiety gives Mr Biden leverage in asserting that lowering tensions is in everyone’s interest.

37
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,760
Encouraging diplomacy does not mean withdrawing all American troops.

38
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,800
They have helped suppress Islamic State and al-Qaeda, which are still active.

39
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,150
And soft power tends to be more effective when hard power lurks in the background.

40
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:25,610
For example, the air strike on an Iranian-backed militia in Syria last month was retaliation for an attack on Americans in Iraq—and a signal to the government in Tehran that Mr Biden would not roll over in negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal.

41
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:34,470
Talking is not easy but, if America wants to focus less on a troubled part of the world, it is the only way ahead.
