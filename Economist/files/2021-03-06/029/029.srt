00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:31,549
AUSTRALIANS ARE proud of their country’s impressive if stringent handling of the coronavirus pandemic: just over 900 deaths to date out of a population of 25m, with a mere eight or so new cases each day.

2
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:39,960
That achievement is one reason why the scene after the men’s final at the Australian Open tennis tournament late last month shocked so many.

3
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:54,990
In her comments at the presentation of the trophy, before both local spectators and a global television audience, Australia’s tennis chief suggested it was a time for“optimism and hope”, with vaccinations“rolling out in many countries in the world”.

4
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,360
Australia’s programme was to begin the following day.

5
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,810
Yet instead of cheers, her remarks were drowned out by the boos of anti-vaxxers in the crowd.

6
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:11,309
The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, called the behaviour“disgusting”and sought to portray the jeerers as party-poopers.

7
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,340
His boss, Scott Morrison, was injected before the cameras with one of the 60,000 shots in the country’s first shipment of vaccines.

8
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,100
Most of the rest are for front-line health and quarantine workers.

9
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,730
The government promises swift progress, after an admittedly slow start.

10
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,560
Yet reluctance to receive vaccines is an issue.

11
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,720
Anti-vaxxers have marched in Melbourne and Sydney.

12
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,309
In many countries, vaccine acceptance has risen sharply along with the prospects of getting a jab.

13
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:55,990
But a study by Imperial College London of global attitudes towards covid-19 vaccines found that Australia was one of four out of 15 rich countries in the Americas, Asia and Europe where vaccine acceptance fell between November and January.

14
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,470
Strikingly, the other three are also in Asia: Japan, Singapore and South Korea.

15
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:11,580
They too have impressive records handling the pandemic, with just 7,984, 1,612 and 29 deaths respectively.

16
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:23,040
These countries’ relatively slow roll-out of vaccines compared with Britain and America, let alone Israel, may soon turn them from laurel-winners to laggards in the fight against covid-19.

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,450
Misinformation, conspiracy theories and distrust of Chinese vaccines have contributed to the hesitancy.

18
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:39,820
But so too, argues Tikki Pangestu of the National University of Singapore, has an awareness that new and seemingly improved vaccines keep appearing.

19
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:54,039
Singaporeans of a certain age say that, given the virus’s ongoing mutations and the possibility that antibodies may not work for ever, they would rather hold off until they really need a jab—and then get the very latest and best.

20
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,689
Others worry about possible side-effects.

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,380
In South Korea half of those polled say they would rather see what happens elsewhere before receiving a vaccine.

22
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,860
With cases low and normal life resuming, the risks of delay strike many in Singapore and South Korea as negligible.

23
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:14,069
This foot-dragging is mirrored by governments.

24
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:20,840
South Korea pinned early hopes on home-grown vaccines, putting in orders for foreign-made ones only in November.

25
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,570
In Japan the government has a rocky history of lawsuits over possible side-effects from measles and mumps shots.

26
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,540
It does not want to look as if it is rushing things.

27
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:40,640
In fact, rather absurdly, it has demanded extra clinical trials of covid-19 vaccines on Japanese people specifically as a condition of approval.

28
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,470
The vaccination of health-care workers began only last month.

29
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,170
The elderly will not get jabs before April.

30
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,039
Most of the rest of the population will not start being vaccinated until midsummer.

31
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,330
That hardly improves the chances of holding a normal Olympics in Tokyo in July.

32
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,140
Shortages of supply, largely beyond governments’ control, will also cause delays.

33
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:10,660
Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, warns that there will not be enough vaccines for everyone until the third quarter of the year.

34
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,890
It may take until the end of the year to complete the vaccination programme.

35
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:25,110
Whatever the cause of the sluggish roll-out, it is of greater concern than might at first be obvious considering that the countries concerned have such low infection rates.

36
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:33,070
In contrast to Europe and North America, success in curbing covid-19 means they have virtually no herd immunity.

37
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,520
Moreover, Asian governments’ rapid travel bans suggest a high aversion to risk.

38
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,560
That is unlikely to change.

39
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,350
Even a mooted travel“bubble”between Singapore and Hong Kong is on hold.

40
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:55,650
Dr Pangestu predicts that Singapore, for one, will remain“obsessive”about not quickly reopening its borders, even for inbound travellers with covid-19“passports”.

41
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,610
They are no guarantee that you are not infectious, after all.

42
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,829
If Banyan had to bet on when Asian travel will resume, it will not be this year.
