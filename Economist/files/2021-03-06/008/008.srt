1
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:25,190
PURGES HAVE grown more common since Xi Jinping took over as China’s leader in 2012.

2
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:34,210
To curb graft and snuff out any opposition to his rule, Mr Xi has been hunting in every corner of the country’s vast bureaucracy.

3
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,820
Hundreds of thousands of officials have been punished.

4
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,750
Thousands, many of them high-ranking, have been sent to prison.

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,029
Remarkably, however, some people do not appear to have got the message.

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,100
A new campaign has just been launched within the domestic security services (see article).

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,900
Weeding out the disloyal is its primary goal.

8
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,150
Can there still be serious opposition to Mr Xi?

9
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,240
There is certainly little sign of it on the streets.

10
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,280
Many ordinary citizens express content with his rule.

11
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,629
Under him, China has become far more influential globally.

12
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:17,430
The economy has kept on growing at a healthy rate (and surprisingly well despite the pandemic).

13
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,300
His anti-corruption efforts are popular.

14
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,620
Neither is there any obvious sign of discontent within the Communist Party elite.

15
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:34,590
It seems likely that many bitterly resent the anti-graft inspectors, and that some senior officials even gnash their teeth.

16
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:41,560
But those with misgivings about Mr Xi know they must keep their mouths shut and their heads down.

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:50,980
A lesson from this latest purge, however, is that the outside world only dimly understands Mr Xi’s political world.

18
00:01:51,780 --> 00:02:02,340
One stated aim of the campaign is to remove the“pernicious influence”of Zhou Yongkang, who was China’s security overlord just before Mr Xi took power.

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,770
Mr Zhou was jailed in 2015 for corruption and leaking state secrets.

20
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:17,680
Officials also accused him of“political plotting”—shorthand, many observers believe, for scheming against Mr Xi.

21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:27,460
That his name is still being invoked years later hints at tensions, but it is hard for outsiders to judge how serious they are.

22
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:41,559
The agencies being targeted in the new campaign occupy the darkest corners of an opaque political system: the police, the secret police, the judiciary and the prison service.

23
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,410
In the months leading up to the purge several powerful figures within this apparatus were toppled.

24
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,420
One was the chief of police in Shanghai, who has been accused of forming“factions”.

25
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,690
All detail of what that may mean is a closely guarded secret.

26
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,570
Despite this, the new purge contains clear messages.

27
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,290
One is Mr Xi’s appetite for power.

28
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:15,610
The campaign will wrap up in time for a big political event late in 2022: the five-yearly party congress.

29
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:27,070
He looks sure to use this to extend his rule for another five years, in defiance of the convention that general secretaries step down after a decade.

30
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:34,660
Tightening control over the security forces will help crush any opposition to his innovation.

31
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:39,180
That raises the other, still bigger, reason to pay attention.

32
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:53,769
For all the seeming relentlessness of the rise of China under an increasingly adamantine authoritarianism, politics can pack surprises that suddenly change the country’s trajectory.

33
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:20,220
Consider the arrest of Mao Zedong’s widow and others in the“Gang of Four”in 1976, the struggle that brought Deng Xiaoping to power two years later, the regime-threatening splits within the party that emerged during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the political bloodletting that eliminated Mr Xi’s rivals in the lead-up to his own anointment.

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,550
You cannot rule out more such disruptive shocks.

35
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:33,310
In the build-up to next year’s congress, the murky waters of Chinese politics will deserve even closer scrutiny.

36
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,140
That is in part because Mr Xi defies norms.

37
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:49,970
As well as rejecting the modern principle that China’s leader gets only ten years at the top, he has seized more levers of power than any ruler since Mao.

38
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,710
It is also because, under Mr Xi, the regime has become even more secretive.

39
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:04,989
Alas, such secrecy makes for a government less accountable to citizens and more likely to catch the world unaware.
