00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,400
THE PANDEMIC is throwing up a new set of ethical issues for businesses.

2
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:29,040
The premise of“stakeholder capitalism”is not just that firms should consider the interests of employees and customers, as well as shareholders.

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:36,959
It is that, by doing so, everyone gains; shareholders will prosper if workers and customers are treated decently.

4
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,560
But the pandemic may put different groups at odds.

5
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:49,200
For example, customers may want companies to insist that all employees are vaccinated, while not wanting the same rule to apply to themselves.

6
00:00:50,190 --> 00:01:03,730
It might seem as if shareholders would want as many employees to return to work as possible, few potential customers to be excluded, and interactions in, say, shops and restaurants to be as free from restrictions as possible.

7
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:13,740
But if a company gets a reputation for being an unsafe place to work, or for customers to visit, the effect on long-term returns could be significant.

8
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,140
The perception of fairness is also essential.

9
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:26,920
Woe betide the executive who jumps the queue, as in the case of Mark Machin, a Canadian pension-fund boss who travelled to the United Arab Emirates to get the jab.

10
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:28,899
(He swiftly resigned.

11
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,920
)  Companies are not just trading off safety and personal liberty.

12
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:43,129
They risk discriminating against those who have yet to gain access to the vaccine or who, for religious or medical reasons, are unwilling or unable to be jabbed.

13
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,819
And they do not have complete freedom of action.

14
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:57,319
The legal situation will vary from country to country but it seems likely that, in many jurisdictions, companies will be able to insist on a vaccine mandate only for new employees.

15
00:01:58,309 --> 00:02:01,949
The question of vaccination is particularly pressing in health care.

16
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:06,299
One might hope that medical workers would appreciate the need for it.

17
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:13,690
Yet some health-care personnel may feel that having had covid-19, as many have, negates the obligation.

18
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:32,519
Laura Boudreau of Columbia Business School in New York observes that, in this type of industry,“there is a duty for the employer to try to identify safe roles that the staff can play, and if not, to provide information to customers about whether there are unvaccinated staff in the role.”

19
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:38,460
In other words, unvaccinated staff may end up being kept away from vulnerable patients.

20
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,480
Rules in other industries often lack consistency.

21
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:46,580
Early in the pandemic, cruise ships helped to spread the disease.

22
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:55,870
The Saga cruise line, which targets elderly travellers, is now insisting that passengers produce proof of vaccination, but makes no such demand of the crew.

23
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,479
That makes sense.

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,770
The passengers will largely be drawn from the rich world, where the elderly have been first in the queue for jabs.

25
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,200
The crew will be younger and often from poorer countries.

26
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,500
In both cases vaccines will have been harder to obtain.

27
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,640
However, the industry is not taking a consistent approach.

28
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,480
Swan Hellenic is insisting on vaccines for crew, not passengers.

29
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,310
Victory Cruise Lines has made a jab mandatory for both groups.

30
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,210
No vaccine is 100% effective.

31
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,649
It is not yet clear whether people who have been vaccinated can still transmit the disease to others.

32
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:42,320
So where staff come into contact with customers, companies may insist on social distancing or mask-wearing until case levels drop substantially.

33
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,040
Even then, employees may catch the virus from each other.

34
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,380
Later, companies will have to consider what they should do when vaccines become more widely available.

35
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,150
Some staff may have been unable to get a vaccine, because they have a medical condition (such as pregnancy) that excludes them.

36
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,669
Do companies have a duty of care to protect such employees from colleagues who have refused to take the jab on principle?

37
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:26,630
In the case of most companies, Ms Boudreau says, it is very much in their interest“to reduce barriers for eligible staff to get vaccines, to have a dialogue with their staff to understand if and why they may be hesitant to get vaccinated, and to provide information and resources that may help those who are reluctant”.

38
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:30,049
But that is probably as far as they can go.

39
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,740
The type of jab people have received then becomes more significant.

40
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,039
In short, managers will face a series of trade-offs.

41
00:04:44,099 --> 00:05:00,730
Their best option may be to accept the uncertainties, remain flexible, ensure the best possible hygiene standards for their staff—and hope that acquired immunity, vaccines and therapies make covid-19 no more life-threatening than seasonal flu.
