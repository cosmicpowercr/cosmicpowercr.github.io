00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:28,060
SINCE CHINA imposed a draconian security law on Hong Kong last year, protests in the city—already dampened by pandemic-related controls—have been rare.

2
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:36,979
But on March 1st hundreds of people gathered outside a court to demonstrate against the largest case so far related to the security bill.

3
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:46,290
They held banners calling for the release of“political prisoners”and chanted slogans that were popular during the unrest that engulfed the territory in 2019.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,510
Students at a primary school nearby stood outside their classrooms, shouting in solidarity.

5
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,760
It was a rare act of defiance in a city that, to many residents, feels crushed.

6
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:05,030
A day earlier, 47 people had been charged for alleged misdeeds as part of the case.

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:28,590
They included some of Hong Kong’s best-known pro-democracy activists, such as Leung Kwok-hung, a veteran campaigner commonly known as“Long Hair”; Lester Shum, a politician; Benny Tai, an academic, and Joshua Wong, whose then-teenage face became emblematic of the“Umbrella Movement”of 2014 (he is already in prison for a protest-related offence).

8
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:36,890
They have been accused of crimes such as conspiracy to commit subversion by plotting to overthrow Hong Kong’s government.

9
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,510
The case relates to an informal primary ballot that was held last year to select pro-democracy candidates for elections to the Legislative Council.

10
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:53,350
This sensible-sounding effort was seen by the government as an attempt to gain control of the council and paralyse its work.

11
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,450
(The elections were due to be held in September but were postponed for a year, purportedly because of the pandemic.

12
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:04,779
) If convicted, the defendants face sentences of up to life in prison.

13
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:12,860
The proceedings that began on March 1st relate to applications for bail—the trial itself may not begin for several more weeks.

14
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:24,480
Under the security law, there is a presumption that bail will be denied, so even this stage has involved protracted debate in court and a gruelling ordeal for the defendants.

15
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,520
They have had to endure sessions lasting many hours that have eaten into normal times for meals and sleep.

16
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,920
The physical toll has been evident—several of them have received hospital treatment.

17
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:48,540
They will remain in custody pending an appeal by the prosecution, which argues that they could pose a threat to national security if released.

18
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,180
No national-security trial has yet been concluded.

19
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:06,850
So this one will be watched for signs of how the new law—which has the hallmarks of Chinese mainland-style legislation, with its vaguely defined political terms—works in a judicial system steeped in British legal tradition.

20
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,889
Dominic Raab, Britain’s foreign minister, has described the case as“deeply disturbing”.

21
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,770
America and the European Union have called for the release of the 47 activists.

22
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:28,420
On March 2nd Hong Kong’s Department of Justice said that prosecutors’ decisions had been made“without political considerations”and no one should interfere in them.

23
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:41,270
But a few days before the 47 were charged, Xia Baolong, a central-government official who oversees Hong Kong affairs, had said that“anti-China elements”should be“severely punished under the law”.

24
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,369
He had named two members of the group: Mr Wong and Mr Tai.

25
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,510
The Communist Party may be an exception to Hong Kong’s rule.
